    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel

sandbox:
  note: If a threat actor gained control over the kernel, the vulnerability could be exploited to escape a sandbox. This could allow privilege escalation, resource access, and path traversal.
  answer: True
  question: |
    Did this vulnerability violate a sandboxing feature that the system
    provides?

    A sandboxing feature is one that allows files, users, or other features
    limited access. Vulnerabilities that violate sandboxes are usually based on
    access control, checking privileges incorrectly, path traversal, and the
    like.

mistakes:
  answer: The vulnerability described in CVE-2013-7348 may have arisen from a combination of coding mistakes, design flaws, and shortcomings in error handling. In this case, the code related to asynchronous I/O (AIO) operations within the Linux kernel may have lacked robust resource management, leading to memory corruption and potential privilege escalation. Coding mistakes, such as improper memory allocation and deallocation, could have played a role, as well as complex code that made it harder to identify vulnerabilities. Additionally, design flaws in the implementation of AIO and resource allocation might have contributed to the issue. Testing gaps and a potential lack of comprehensive security testing could have allowed the vulnerability to go undetected. Adequate documentation, clear security requirements, and heightened security awareness among developers and reviewers are essential in mitigating such vulnerabilities and maintaining robust security in software systems.

  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    There can, and usually are, many mistakes behind a vulnerability.

    Remember that mistakes can come in many forms:
    * slip: failing to complete a properly planned step due to inattention
              e.g. wrong key in the ignition
              e.g. using < instead of <=
    * lapse: failing to complete a properly planned step due to memory failure
              e.g. forgetting to put car in reverse before backing up
              e.g. forgetting to check null
    * planning error: error that occurs when the plan is inadequate
              e.g. getting stuck in traffic because you didn't consider the
                   impact of the bridge closing
              e.g. calling the wrong method
              e.g. using a poor design

    These are grey areas, of course. But do your best to analyze the mistakes
    according to this framework.

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Write a thoughtful entry here that people in the software engineering
    industry would find interesting.
nickname:
subsystem:
  name: fs
  note: This vulnerability involves asynchronous I/O (AIO) implementation, which deals with file I/O operations and resource management. Issues related to file I/O, memory allocation, and resource management are typically associated with the "fs" subsystem, as it deals with the file system operations and related kernel functionality.
  question: >
    What subsystems was the mistake in? These are WITHIN linux kernel


    Determining the subsystem is a subjective task. This is to help us group
     similar vulnerabilities, so choose a subsystem that other vulnerabilities would be in. Y

    Some areas to look for pertinent information:
      - Bug labels
      - Directory names
      - How developers refer to an area of the system in comments,
        commit messages, etc.

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get

    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how

    the bug report was tagged.


    Example linux kernel subsystems are:
      * drivers
      * crypto
      * fs
      * net
      * lib

    Name should be:
      * all lowercase English letters
      * NOT a specific file
      * can have digits, and _-@/

    Can be multiple subsystems involved, in which case you can make it an array

    e.g.
        name: ["subsystemA", "subsystemB"] # ok
        name: subsystemA # also ok
discovered:
  answer: After looking through kernel.org, openwall.com, and github, I wasn't able to find any evidence as to how this vulnerability was found.

forgotten_check:
  note:
  answer:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve adding a forgotten check?

    A "forgotten check" can mean many things. It often manifests as the fix
    inserting an entire if-statement or a conditional to an existing
    if-statement. Or a call to a method that checks something.

    Example of checks can include:
      * null pointer checks
      * check the current role, e.g. root
      * boundary checks for a number
      * consult file permissions
      * check a return value

    Answer must be true or false.

autodiscoverable:
  note:
  answer:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

    In systemd, the actually use OZZ Fuzz. If there's a link to it, add it here.

    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
