CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 94

curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Struts-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Struts would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  A specially crafted request parameter could be used to inject arbitrary
  code, which could then be used as request parameter of a URL or anchor tag.
  Then the URL/anchor tag tries to resolve every parameter present in the
  original request. This lets malicious users put arbitrary statements into any
  request parameter and have it evaluated to enable method execution and execute
  arbitrary methods, which bypasses any library protections. This vulnerability was
  introduced as a partial fix to a previously identified bug.

  - commit: d934c6e7430b7b98e43a0a085a2304bd31a75c3d
    note: |
      Improved security by making static method attribute immutable (a final variable).
      No longer passing parameter name or value to OGNL evaluation.
vccs:
  - commit: 0c543aef318341ca9bd482e15f1637497b8a4dfd
    note: |
      Defined static method attribute as mutable. No longer passing parameters
      to OGNL evaluation.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: The file this vulnerability was found in did have unit tests, however
    this bug was a design flaw (immutable variable) and the tests were not related
    to this vulnerability or the associated fix.
  code: false
  fix: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Apache
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulnerability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.
    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "apache" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    I looked in the linked CVE and NVD resources, including the Red Hat bugzilla report.
    Through the bugzilla entry I was able to find the initial reporter Vincent Danen, a
    Red Hat employee, but they gave no description as to how they found this vulnerability.
  date: 2013-05-27
  automated:
  apache: false
  contest:

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: "url rendering for OGNL evaluation"
  name: "url"

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section
    by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: There were no commits to the SecurityMemberAccess.java file between the VCC
    and the fix. However other components of the url rendering subsytem were modified
    during the three years between those commits.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      Before the fix was introduced, there was no way to escape/sanitize an unexpected
      malicious parameter in a request and since it won't get evaluated, the request
      parameters are processed.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those in the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was due to a fundamental flaw in the design of the url rendering
    system and the subsequent fix in 2.3.14.1 did not fully address all possible attack
    vectors. Rearchitecting the url rendering subsystem to not pass any vulnerable
    parameters and changing the allowStaticMethodAccess property to be immutable seemed
    to completely fix the original vulnerability reported in 2010.
