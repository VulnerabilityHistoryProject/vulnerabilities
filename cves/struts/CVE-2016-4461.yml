description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Struts-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Struts would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  This vulnerability stems from improper input validation within Apache Struts
  in relation to OGNL, more formally known as Object Graph Navigation Language.
  OGNL is an expression language used to access and mutate Java Object properties,
  as well as interact with other forms of metadata.
  In this instance, OGNL's expression evaluation operator "%{}" can be used to force
  double evaluation of a Struts data object attribute. Double evaluation is when an expression string is
  evaluated as code such that its output is also evaluated as code. Without a defined base case, this
  process can recurse indefinitely.
  With respect to Apache Struts, a malicious actor can provide a string containing "%{}" that,
  when evaluated at a later point in time, forces double evaluation. In the event a malicious actor
  encodes program instructions within their provided string input, this vulnerability allows for
  arbitrary code execution within the system.
  It is important to note that this vulnerability stems from an incomplete solution to a prior issue
  in Apache version 2.3.28, classified as S2-029 in Apache's wiki (CVE-2016-0785).

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those in the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    Overall, this vulnerability stems from failure to consider the security principle of "secure by default".
    Failure to consider malicious use of the OGNL language, especially when forcing expression evaluations 
    using "%{}" syntax, shows that adequate threat modeling was not done in preparation for integrating with this feature.
    Likewise, failure to account for potential malicious inputs when executing expressions signifies a lack of
    consideration for the increased attack surface that results from complex inputs.
    Considering the predecessor issue "S2-029" was supposed to be fixed in the version 2.3.28 release, the
    fact that the same issue re-appeared as "S2-036" proves a lack of understanding in regards to the core issue.
