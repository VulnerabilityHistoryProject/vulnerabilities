description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Struts-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Struts would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  Struts 2 introduced a new feature called Dynamic Method Invocation (DMI). This
  allowed developers to call specific public methods by passing them through the
  url after an exclamation point. This opened up the possibilty for users to call
  other methods by abusing this feature. Abusing this was as simple a modifying the
  url of the request. "http://example.com/route!method1" would call the function
  "method1", while "http://example.com/route!method2" would call method2 instead,
  opening many other potential attack vectors. DMI is defaulted to on for Struts versions
  2.0.0 through 2.3.15.1. Users were not warned about the potential security risks
  of leaving this enabled.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: |
    Automated unit tests were involved since the issue was first introduced. Tests ensured
    that the feature functioned as planned. This issue would not have been caught by the
    tests as it was an issue with default configuration. The default configuration enabled
    an insecure option that opened up potential vectors. At the time, they did not realize
    that this option would have as large of a potential impact.
  code: true
  fix: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Apache
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulnerability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.
    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "apache" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was discovered multiple times by multiple people. The largest instance
    of this being known was opened with ticket WW-3264. This ticket had a large discussion on
    how it could be solved, potentially involving whitelists of what methods could be invoked
  date: 2009-09-26
  automated: false
  apache:
  contest: false

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: The mapper to map urls to methods in the project
  name: mapper

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section
    by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    There were no major interesting commits between the VCC and the fix. There was
    some talk of the best solution to making this vulnerability less likely to have
    negative impact, but no changes were made until the default configuration value
    was changed

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
      The default configuration values for the struts project were insecure
      for the Dynamic Method Invocation feature. Default values for configuration
      should be secure, while giving users the option to turn on the insecure features.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those in the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    A big mistake that contributed to this was defaulting a potentially insecure
    configuration option to be on. By defaulting Dynamic Method Invocation to on
    users did not have a prior warning on what vulnerabilities this potentially
    introduced. If this were to be defaulted to on, a whitelist should have been
    included by default, so users would still have to opt into the insecure option.
