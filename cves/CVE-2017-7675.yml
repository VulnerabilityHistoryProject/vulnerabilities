description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  This vulnerability involves the processing of an HTTP request
  where one of the path parameters is a URL with the ability to traverse outside
  of the folder where the module is pointing, depending on the URL string that
  the user passes to the server.

  This ultimately happens because, for that particular parameter (and maybe
  others) a number of existing security checks were skipped over in the
  implementation.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: |
    It does not appear that the original case was unit tested, because
    an entirely new test class (TestStream.java) was added to the system. Looking
    at other unit tests in the same directory, there don't appear to be any unit
    tests that caught the case where the session ID was changed (an indication 
    of the root issue). 
  code: false
  fix: true

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found.
    * Answer in longform below in "answer"
    * Fill in the date in YYYY-MM-DD
    * If it's clear that the vulnerability was discovered by a contest,
      fill in the name there.
    * The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you
    may leave the entries blank except for "answer", BUT please write down
    where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    The vulnerability was discovered by Markus Dörschmidt. His original
    report can be found here; https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=61120

    The vulnerability was noticed without a full understanding of the implications
    of the vulnerability. Markus discovered that using the HTTP/2 module would cause
    some request parameters to disappear ("all URL path parameters"). 
  date: 2017-05-24
  automated: false
  contest: false

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
    Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: |
    Based on the directory structure, the commit message and the
    original bug report, the vulnerability exists in the http2 module. 
  name: http2

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this
    section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer:
  commits:
    - commit: 0e98a962b28a4d5a042b02df53b9b0e00337889c 
      note: |
        This commit was merged in a month before the bug was reported and 
        adjusts the chunk of code that caused the vulnerability. However, it
        merely adjusted the indenting of the chunk and the structure of some of 
        the surrounding logic.

        Of more interest is the commit message! ":path header must not be empty".
        This seems to imply that signs of the vulnerability were noticed elsewhere,
        but the true cause of the issue waas not fully understood at the time.

        There are a few commits in between here and the original VCC.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note: |
      Perhaps this shouldn't be the only spot where we're able to prevent
      traversal based vulnerabilities? While we may need different functions
      or cases to parse parameter strings, perhaps we can apply a blanket
      validation after any of those cases are considered! This is also
      a good reason for looking into proper permissions (maybe sandboxes)
      when devs go to host servers using this technology.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    Based on the comments surrounding the original implementation, as well as
    the brief history of commits revolving around the chunk of code containing
    the vulnerability and the lack of targeted unit tests; this vulnerability
    was most certainly caused by a lack of proper risk assessment. 

    With a comment like "This is almost certainly wrong and needs to be decoded",
    it seems like this part of the code didn't receive the proper amount of
    attention to determine that it may lead to some vulnerabilities if not
    properly tested.
