CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE entry
  that describes your vulnerability. (Tip: this may not be a good one to start
  with - spend time understanding this vulnerability before making your choice!)
CWE: 20

curated_instructions: |
  If you are manually editing this file, then you are "curating" it. Set the
  entry below to "true" as soon as you start. This will enable additional
  integrity checks on this file to make sure you fill everything out properly.
  If you are a student, we cannot accept your work as finished unless curated is
  set to true.
curated: true

announced_instructions: |
  Was there a date that this vulnerability was announced to the world? You can
  find this in changelogs, blogs, bug reports, or perhaps the CVE data.
  Please enter your date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Struts-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Struts would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  This vulnerability allows for an infinite loop to occur, meaning the program is thus vulnerable for
  a DoS (Denial of Service) attack. The exploit would come in the form of sending an HTTP request with a Content-Type header
  with an extremely high length.

  vulnerability, fill it out here. Or correct it if the information already here

fixes_vcc_instructions: |
  Please put the SVN commit number in "commit" below, and any notes about how this
  was discovered in the "note" field.
fixes:
  - commit: 2dceb870fdb1d6d64904f3bf6a5fec59ffa9fe99
    note: |
      Updates commons-fileupload version. This was discovered by first realizing that Struts uses the Tomcat API, and thus the vulnerability could have
      come from code existing in the Tomcat codebase (see 29384723d8d9645b87e05be9fa369a4deeb78b9c). I then checked the git log for commits containing the CVE
      and found a commit that directly refers to it; The commit not only creates a test for a boundary condition that
      fixes the vulnerability, but it also adds a unit test for this case.

# - commit: 9a43f74534b901d4a4bd7206120c4429371049ec
#   note: |
#     Code was inserted that defines a function that does not throw an exception if there is input that will
#     cause the program to go into an infinite loop

upvotes_instructions: |
  Students: when initially writing this, ignore this upvotes number.
  Once this work is being reviewed, you will be giving a certain amount of
  upvotes to each vulnerability you see. Your peers will tell you how
  interesting they think this vulnerability is, and you'll add that to the
  upvotes score on your branch.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: |
    The original code did not test for this boundary situation, and this function was originally
    untouched by the unit tests. Once fixed however, the function and condition was tested for.
  code: false
  fix: true

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Apache
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulnerability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.
    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "apache" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    Searched through each link on cve.mitre.org as well as a thorough search of the git log and found
    nothing on the origin of this bug. It was initially reported by Peter Magnusson.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: The File upload portion of Apache Commons, found in Tomcat source code
  name: FileUpload

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section
    by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    Between September of 2013 and February of 2014, this vulnerability existed. Multiple "infinite loop" bugs were mentioned
    in the commit history between those dates, but none of them addressed the bug at hand.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
      This vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious attacker curating an HTTP request with a custom Content-Type header
      purely with the intentions of creating a DoS attack. Because of this possibility, the source code must
      account for it and assume that all input has potential to be malicious.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those in the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    I would say that this would be a coding mistake. In the implementation of this piece of code, the author had mentioned
    in the Git log that he had attempted to account for all of the "sneaky boundary cases". This goes to show just how
    sneaky they can be in that there was a bug stemming from input being above a certain length.

    That said, it is difficult to blame this on the programmer, given that the vulnerability could only be exploited by an attack
    vector specifically meant to be strange and unlikely.
