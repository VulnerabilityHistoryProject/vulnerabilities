  =================
  ===YAML Primer===
  =================
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not absolutely required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  This vulnerability was in systemd versions 223-233 within the dns_packet_new() 
  function.

  Some sizes passed to the dns_packet_new() function would cause the function to
  allocate too small of a buffer, leaving the system vulnerable to a buffer 
  overflow. More specifically, sizes close to the page size would cause the 
  function to allocate less memory than requested.

  With this vulnerability, a malicious TCP transmission could be crafted by a 
  remote user to trick the function into allocating a buffer that's too small and 
  thus allow for arbitrary code execution beyond the end of the buffer.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For code: and fix: - your answer should be boolean.

    For the code_answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix in related directories and determine if and was there were
    unit tests involved for this subsystem.

    For the fix_answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  code: false
  code_answer: |
    Originally there were no unit tests involved in discovering a buffer
    overflow within this function.
  fix: true
  fix_answer: |
    An additional patch was released containing a unit test for this vulnerability.
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please
    explain where you looked.
  answer: |
    There is no specific evidence as to how the vulnerability was found, but it
    was discovered by Chris Coulson. His email transcript to the security team 
    from Jun. 27, 2017 can be found at: 
    https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/06/27/8.
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: true
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

    In systemd, the actually use OZZ Fuzz. If there's a link to it, add it here.

    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: |
    An automated tool would likely not have been able to discover the buffer 
    overflow vulnerability being that it would have to know specifically which 
    value(s) would trigger the proper buffer allocation to execute the attack and 
    specifically craft a TCP payload to take advantage. The tool would simply not 
    have the knowledge or reason to attempt an exploit on dns_packet_new().
  answer: false
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example, the POSIX
    spec, an RFC spec, a network protocol spec, or some other requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check the following artifacts for this:
      * bug reports
      * security advisories
      * commit message
      * pull request
      * mailing lists
      * anything else

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: |
    There is no mention of a specification in any blogs, bug reports, or 
    transcripts.
  answer: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in? These are subsystems WITHIN systemd

    Two areas to look:
      - Bug labels
      - Directory names

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. 

    Example systemd subsystems are:
      * fsck
      * apparmor
      * fstab
      * sd-daemon

    Name should be:
      * all lowercase English letters
      * NOT a specific file
      * can have digits, and _-@/

    Can be multiple subsystems involved, in which case you can make it an array
    e.g.
        name: ["subsystemA", "subsystemB"] # ok
        name: subsystemA # also ok
  name: resolve
  note: The mistake exists in resolved-dns-packet.c which is within the resolve subsystem.

i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)?

    An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    The function that was affected simply pertained to allocating memory for 
    a DNS packet.
sandbox:
  question: |
    Did this vulnerability violate a sandboxing feature that the system
    provides? 

    A sandboxing feature is one that allows files, users, or other features 
    limited access. Vulnerabilities that violate sandboxes are usually based on 
    access control, checking privileges incorrectly, path traversal, and the 
    like.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: |
    Exploiting this vulnerability would allow a malicious user to access files 
    and directories via arbitrary code execution that should not be accessible.
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    The function that was affected simply pertained to allocating memory for 
    a DNS packet.
discussion:
  question: |
    Was there any discussion surrounding this?

    A discussion can include debates, disputes, or polite talk about how to 
    resolve uncertainty.

    Example include:
      * Is this out of our scope?
      * Is this a security?
      * How should we fix this?

    Just because you see multiple comments doesn't mean it's a discussion. 
    For example:
      * "Fix line 10". "Ok" is not what we call a discussion
      * "Ping" (reminding people)

    Check the bugs reports, pull requests, and mailing lists archives.

    These answers should be boolean.
      discussed_as_security: true or false
      any_discussion: true or false

    Put any links to disagreements you found in the notes section, or any other
    comment you want to make.
  discussed_as_security: false
  any_discussion: true
  note: "https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/6214"
vouch:
  question: |
    Was there any part of the fix that involved one person vouching for 
    another's work?

    This can include:
      * signing off on a commit message
      * mentioning a discussion with a colleague checking the work
      * upvoting a solution on a pull request

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: "In the GitHub issues thread, several users check off on the revision commit."
stacktrace:
  question: |
    Are there any stacktraces in the bug reports? 

    Secondly, if there is a stacktrace, is the fix in the same file that the 
    stacktrace points to? 

    If there are no stacktraces, then both of these are false - but be sure to
    mention where you checked in the note.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  any_stacktraces: false
  stacktrace_with_fix: false
  note: |
    No stacktrace found in NVD, mailing lists, or bug reports.

forgotten_check:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve adding a forgotten check?

    A "forgotten check" can mean many things. It often manifests as the fix 
    inserting an entire if-statement or a conditional to an existing 
    if-statement. Or a call to a method that checks something.

    Example of checks can include:
      * null pointer checks
      * check the current role, e.g. root
      * boundary checks for a number
      * consult file permissions
      * check a return value

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: |
    The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the memory allocated is 
    greater than the absolute minimum.
order_of_operations:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve correcting an order of 
    operations?

    This means the fix involves moving code around or changing the order of 
    how things are done. 

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    The fix does not change the order of operations but changes the conditional 
    statement.
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    There can, and usually are, many mistakes behind a vulnerability.

    Remember that mistakes can come in many forms:
    * slip: failing to complete a properly planned step due to inattention
              e.g. wrong key in the ignition
              e.g. using < instead of <=
    * lapse: failing to complete a properly planned step due to memory failure
              e.g. forgetting to put car in reverse before backing up
              e.g. forgetting to check null
    * planning error: error that occurs when the plan is inadequate
              e.g. getting stuck in traffic because you didn’t consider the 
                   impact of the bridge closing
              e.g. calling the wrong method
              e.g. using a poor design

    These are grey areas, of course. But do your best to analyze the mistakes 
    according to this framework.

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Write a thoughtful entry here that people in the software engineering
    industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    I would consider this vulnerability to have been caused by a planning error,
    where the developers failed to consider the possibility of a buffer overflow 
    occuring only when certain sizes are passed to the function. Failing to plan 
    for or test for this error is a large mistake that could have been dangerous 
    had it been known for longer before it was patched. 

    As far as the potential mitigation for this vulnerability, the patch doesn't 
    appear to adhere to any of the mitigations. The new code simply ensures that 
    the buffer that is allocated is never smaller than the minimum size, and will 
    default to allocating the minimum size if less is calculated.
