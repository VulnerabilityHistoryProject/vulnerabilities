  =================
  ===YAML Primer===
  =================
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not absolutely required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  A systemd services that used the DynamicUser property(assigns a unique UID to the service at run time) was able to
  create SUID/SGID(saved user id/ saved group id) binaries that could later run as a
  transient service. The DynamicUser property allows systemd to dynamicly assign a unique UID(user id) to the service.
  The issue was that once the service had a UID any files that it created would have a SUID/SGID that maped to the UID
  of the service that created it. Because of the SUID/SGID these transiant services were efectivly
  allowed to run with the same privileges as the systemd service. An exploit could be used to write binaries that could
  later be executed with elevated privlages and access resources owned by other services even after the systemd service
  had been terminated.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For code: and fix: - your answer should be boolean.

    For the code_answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix in related directories and determine if and was there were
    unit tests involved for this subsystem.

    For the fix_answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  code: true
  code_answer: |
    The code did include uinittests prior to the fix but the function that calls the function to the fix is not tested
    as far as I can tell. The function that calls the fix is nearly 1000 lines long and is full of nested if statements.
    It would be very dificlut to test.
    The following link shows the fuction (seccomp_restrict_suid_sgid) that was added as a fix
    https://github.com/poettering/systemd/blob/6d85ba729949c00e4723b9517f804b9016ede6e9/src/shared/seccomp-util.c#L1806

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please
    explain where you looked.
  answer: |
    This bug was found 2019-03-13 by a Google employee
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: true
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

    In systemd, the actually use OZZ Fuzz. If there's a link to it, add it here.

    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: |
    This vulnerability is only accessible locally and there for any automated tool 
    would have to run locally and so a fuzzer would not be of much help. That being 
    said, some sort of automated system that was capable of identifying the
    SUID/SGUID binaries it saved using systemd, an automated tool could be used to 
    help identify this vulnerability.
  answer: true
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example, the POSIX
    spec, an RFC spec, a network protocol spec, or some other requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check the following artifacts for this:
      * bug reports
      * security advisories
      * commit message
      * pull request
      * mailing lists
      * anything else

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: |
    When discussing the issue they went as far as to say that the everything was
    working as it should, "I understand what you mean and you are right, everything is working as it
    should, but is that what we really want?" (Riccardo Schirone 2019-02-13, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1814596)
    Schirone goes on to talk about how although it does its intended job it does not isolate itself
    from the rest of the system.
  answer: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in? These are subsystems WITHIN systemd

    Two areas to look:
      - Bug labels
      - Directory names

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. 

    Example systemd subsystems are:
      * fsck
      * apparmor
      * fstab
      * sd-daemon

    Name should be:
      * all lowercase English letters
      * NOT a specific file
      * can have digits, and _-@/

    Can be multiple subsystems involved, in which case you can make it an array
    e.g.
        name: ["subsystemA", "subsystemB"] # ok
        name: subsystemA # also ok

  name: shared
  note:
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Use this to specify any commits you think are notable in some way, and
    explain why in the note.

    note:
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)?

    An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    This vulnerablility is not at all related to localization
sandbox:
  question: |
    Did this vulnerability violate a sandboxing feature that the system
    provides? 

    A sandboxing feature is one that allows files, users, or other features 
    limited access. Vulnerabilities that violate sandboxes are usually based on 
    access control, checking privileges incorrectly, path traversal, and the 
    like.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: This vulnerability exposes resources of other services, even after the current service terminates.
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: |
    This vulnerabily involved changing the permissions on files
discussion:
  question: |
    Was there any discussion surrounding this?

    A discussion can include debates, disputes, or polite talk about how to 
    resolve uncertainty.

    Example include:
      * Is this out of our scope?
      * Is this a security?
      * How should we fix this?

    Just because you see multiple comments doesn't mean it's a discussion. 
    For example:
      * "Fix line 10". "Ok" is not what we call a discussion
      * "Ping" (reminding people)

    Check the bugs reports, pull requests, and mailing lists archives.

    These answers should be boolean.
      discussed_as_security: true or false
      any_discussion: true or false

    Put any links to disagreements you found in the notes section, or any other
    comment you want to make.

  discussed_as_security: false
  any_discussion: true
  note: |
    There was a semi lengthy discussion/disagreement 
    (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/systemd/+bug/1814596)
    about what the problem was and how to fix it. In this, there was a brief mention 
    of what security but it was not really argued and was merely a statement that 
    one person said.

vouch:
  question: |
    Was there any part of the fix that involved one person vouching for 
    another's work?

    This can include:
      * signing off on a commit message
      * mentioning a discussion with a colleague checking the work
      * upvoting a solution on a pull request

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    It’s a bit of a stretch to say that this is vouched for, as no one questioned 
    the fix. There was a very brief discussion in the issue for the commit that 
    fixed this. Either way, the deductions linked to the fix showed a general 
    consensus on the fix when it was found. In the end, the PR was approved by one 
    person.
stacktrace:
  question: |
    Are there any stacktraces in the bug reports? 

    Secondly, if there is a stacktrace, is the fix in the same file that the 
    stacktrace points to? 

    If there are no stacktraces, then both of these are false - but be sure to
    mention where you checked in the note.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  any_stacktraces: true
  stacktrace_with_fix: false
  note: |
    There are no stack traces in the bug reports, however, there is a detailed 
    description of how to replicate the issue 
    (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1771).
    There are stack traces shown in the github issue related to the PR to fix this 
    vulnerability, however none of them seam to point to the file that was causing 
    the issue.(https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/12056)

forgotten_check:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve adding a forgotten check?

    A "forgotten check" can mean many things. It often manifests as the fix 
    inserting an entire if-statement or a conditional to an existing 
    if-statement. Or a call to a method that checks something.

    Example of checks can include:
      * null pointer checks
      * check the current role, e.g. root
      * boundary checks for a number
      * consult file permissions
      * check a return value

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    It is not that issue forgot to check somthing, its that if failed to restrict permitions on files that the systems
    were running.This fixe adds an entire function that set up restrictions on permissions for
    various system calls.
order_of_operations:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve correcting an order of 
    operations?

    This means the fix involves moving code around or changing the order of 
    how things are done. 

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note:
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    There can, and usually are, many mistakes behind a vulnerability.

    Remember that mistakes can come in many forms:
    * slip: failing to complete a properly planned step due to inattention
              e.g. wrong key in the ignition
              e.g. using < instead of <=
    * lapse: failing to complete a properly planned step due to memory failure
              e.g. forgetting to put car in reverse before backing up
              e.g. forgetting to check null
    * planning error: error that occurs when the plan is inadequate
              e.g. getting stuck in traffic because you didn’t consider the 
                   impact of the bridge closing
              e.g. calling the wrong method
              e.g. using a poor design

    These are grey areas, of course. But do your best to analyze the mistakes 
    according to this framework.

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Write a thoughtful entry here that people in the software engineering
    industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    I think the real mistake here was failing to use Disttrusful Decomposition. The 
    issue, in the end, was allowing more privileges to arias that should not have 
    had it. Had this system isolated the arias that needed more privileges from 
    those that did not the ability to elevate other system privileges may have been 
    mitigated.
