description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  CVE-2020-15780 allowed for injection of a malicious ACPI table via configfs.
  ACPI is a form of abstraction that allows the LInux operating system to control
  machine specific hardware. ACPI trelies on ACPI tables for configuations. Configfs
  is a filesystem-based manager of kernel objects. Using configfs, bad actors were 
  able to send malicious ACPI tables that allowed them to override Linux secure boot
  and bypass lockdown. Secure bott is a verification machnism that ensures code 
  launched by the computer's firmware is trusted. The lockdown feature is designed to 
  protect against unauthorized modificaiton fo thekernel memory and preven access to
  security and cryptographci data. Overriding these features could allow a bad actor
  to run untrusted, or malicious code, or gain access to sensitive data.

  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please
    explain where you looked.
  answer: |
    There does not appear to be any evidence as to how the bug was found. I looked for a bug report and found one on both bugzilla.redhat.com and bugzilla.suse.com and neither have any mention of how the bug was found. I was unable to locate a bug report on bugzilla.kernel.com. The bugzilla.suse.com did have a brief conversation dicussion the location of the official upstream fix, but no mention of the original bug discovery. 
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: true
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

    In systemd, the actually use OZZ Fuzz. If there's a link to it, add it here.

    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: |
    It is plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered this. The volnerability was related to a interger overflow, which an automated tool, such as a fuzzer, excels at finding. 
  answer: true
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example, the POSIX
    spec, an RFC spec, a network protocol spec, or some other requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check the following artifacts for this:
      * bug reports
      * security advisories
      * commit message
      * mailing lists
      * anything else

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: |
    The was no mention of violation of specification in any of the bug reports, commit messages, or mailing list archieves. 
  answer: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in? These are WITHIN linux kernel

    Determining the subsystem is a subjective task. This is to help us group
     similar vulnerabilities, so choose a subsystem that other vulnerabilities would be in. Y

    Some areas to look for pertinent information:
      - Bug labels
      - Directory names
      - How developers refer to an area of the system in comments,
        commit messages, etc.

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.

    Example linux kernel subsystems are:
      * drivers
      * crypto
      * fs
      * net
      * lib

    Name should be:
      * all lowercase English letters
      * NOT a specific file
      * can have digits, and _-@/

    Can be multiple subsystems involved, in which case you can make it an array
    e.g.
        name: ["subsystemA", "subsystemB"] # ok
        name: subsystemA # also ok
  name: ["bpf"]
  note: |
    The volunerability was discorved inside of the bpf subsystem. This makese sense, as the error is associated with ePBF.
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Use this to specify any commits you think are notable in some way, and
    explain why in the note.

    Example interesting commits:
      * Mentioned as a problematic commit in the past
        e.g. "This fixes regression in commit xys"
      * A significant rewrite in the git history
      * Other commits that fixed a similar issue as this vulnerability
      * Anything else you find interesting.

i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)?

    An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    This vulnerability has nothing to do with internationalization. It is unrelated to translations, locales, etc. The root cause was an interget overflow, which not an internationalization related issue. 
sandbox:
  question: |
    Did this vulnerability violate a sandboxing feature that the system
    provides?

    A sandboxing feature is one that allows files, users, or other features
    limited access. Vulnerabilities that violate sandboxes are usually based on
    access control, checking privileges incorrectly, path traversal, and the
    like.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: |
    The vulnerability was center around eBPF, which is a Linux kernel tool for running programs in a sandbox. The volnerability allowed the users to exploit a bug in the sandbox to gain higher privilegdes and code in the context of the kernel. 
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    This vulnerability was isolated to a single function call within the eBPF code that did not make use of inter-process communication.
discussion:
  question: |
    Was there any discussion surrounding this?

    A discussion can include debates, disputes, or polite talk about how to
    resolve uncertainty.

    Example include:
      * Is this out of our scope?
      * Is this a security?
      * How should we fix this?

    Just because you see multiple comments doesn't mean it's a discussion.
    For example:
      * "Fix line 10". "Ok" is not what we call a discussion
      * "Ping" (reminding people)

    Check the bugs reports, pull requests, and mailing lists archives.

    These answers should be boolean.
      discussed_as_security: true or false
      any_discussion: true or false

    Put any links to disagreements you found in the notes section, or any other
    comment you want to make.
  discussed_as_security: false
  any_discussion: false
  note: |
    From what I could find, there was no discussion or debate around how the issue should be resolved. The issues of out-of-bounds writes, reads, and improper input validation, while very sever, also have straight forward solutions. It seems that everyone was in agreement that the solution was to add proper input validation to ensure the numbers stay within its bounds. 
vouch:
  question: |
    Was there any part of the fix that involved one person vouching for
    another's work?

    This can include:
      * signing off on a commit message
      * mentioning a discussion with a colleague checking the work
      * upvoting a solution on a pull request

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: |
    All commits involving a fix involved at least one other person approving the work.
stacktrace:
  question: |
    Are there any stacktraces in the bug reports?

    Secondly, if there is a stacktrace, is the fix in the same file that the
    stacktrace points to?

    If there are no stacktraces, then both of these are false - but be sure to
    mention where you checked in the note.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  any_stacktraces: false
  stacktrace_with_fix: false
  note: |
    There are no stack traces that show the error. However, there are examples of what inputs the system produces in both the incorrect and correct state. 
forgotten_check:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve adding a forgotten check?

    A "forgotten check" can mean many things. It often manifests as the fix
    inserting an entire if-statement or a conditional to an existing
    if-statement. Or a call to a method that checks something.

    Example of checks can include:
      * null pointer checks
      * check the current role, e.g. root
      * boundary checks for a number
      * consult file permissions
      * check a return value

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: |
    The solution involved adding a boundary check to the number to ensure that it falls within the bounds of a 32 bit integer. Without these check, there could be out-of-bounds read and writing, leading to arbitrary code execution.
order_of_operations:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve correcting an order of
    operations?

    This means the fix involves moving code around or changing the order of
    how things are done.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    The order of operations stays the same, there is just an additional step. 
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
      One of the core causes of this vulnerability was a lack of input validation. If the system did not trust that the inputs provided to it were correct, it would have needed to validate them in some way. This validation would have preventing the out-of-bounds errors from occuring, thus mitigating the vulnerability.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    There can, and usually are, many mistakes behind a vulnerability.

    Remember that mistakes can come in many forms:
    * slip: failing to complete a properly planned step due to inattention
              e.g. wrong key in the ignition
              e.g. using < instead of <=
    * lapse: failing to complete a properly planned step due to memory failure
              e.g. forgetting to put car in reverse before backing up
              e.g. forgetting to check null
    * planning error: error that occurs when the plan is inadequate
              e.g. getting stuck in traffic because you didn't consider the
                   impact of the bridge closing
              e.g. calling the wrong method
              e.g. using a poor design

    These are grey areas, of course. But do your best to analyze the mistakes
    according to this framework.

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Write a thoughtful entry here that people in the software engineering
    industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    CVE-2021-3490 is a lesson in not trusting user input. The core of the issue arised as a result of a seemly harmless input. But, harmless as it may look, if not properly validated, it could led to arbitary code execution by a bad actor. Out-of-bound reads and writes may be easy issues to correct with simple checks and validations, but if you trust that the data will always look a certain way, you may justtify not including such checks. 

    The biggest mistake that led to this vulnerability was trusting the inputs to the system and thinking they did not need these simple checks. Once it was discovered that a malicious input could be fed into the system, it was only then that they checks were put in place. If the developers followed the principle of distrusting inputs, this vulnerability never would have occured. 

    Looking at the relevenat CWE entries, CWE-20 (Improper Input Validaiton), CWE-125(Out-of-bounds Read), and CWE-787(Out-of_bounds Writes), the mitigations that they suggest were utilized in the patch that fixed CVE-2021-3490. Specically, CWE-20 and CWE-125 mention assuming all input is malicious. They suggest adopting an "accept know good" strategy on the input. The Linux developers took a slightly different approach and simple only return known good outputs. Despite not being exactly what the CWE recommends, it is functional the same in this case and serves to migigate the vulnerability.
