  =================
  ===YAML Primer===
  =================
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: "This vulnerability was very basic, but had some dangerous implications:
  An \nunchecked, external string was being entered into method that calls \n\"strlen()\".
  In C, Strings must be null terminated (a null character must \nbe at the end of
  every string, to signify its end). When strlen is called on\na string that is not
  null terminated, it will continue to look through memory \nuntil it hits a bit defined
  as null, which can result in undefined behavior. \nThe affected subsystem uses an
  NFS (Network File Sharing) protocol to define \nerror traces, which uses file names
  found in its file system daemon (NFSD).  \nSince the input was from an external
  source (the names of files in the file \nsystem), and that input was not verified,
  it was possible that it could not \nbe properly null terminated, and thus could
  result in the system behaving \nin an unintended fashion, and could even lead to
  a denial of service situation.\n"

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please
    explain where you looked.
  answer: "This issue appears to have been discovered on 2021-06-25.\nThere does not
    appear to be a written bug for this defect, and given that, \nthe simplicity of
    the fix, the language in the commit message, and the \nrepairing commit's proximity
    to other commits in the same file, it can be \ninferred that the mistake was discovered
    in passing while making a different\nchange, and was corrected on the spot.\n"
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: true
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

    In systemd, the actually use OZZ Fuzz. If there's a link to it, add it here.

    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: "It would have been possible for an automated tool to feed this area a string
    \nthat is not properly null terminated and discover this fault. Due to the \nrandom
    nature of the issue, and the fact that the offending function call \ndoes not
    return the string length, the results may have been obscured \nsomewhat, and discovering
    the fault may have taken several attempts, but\nit remains possible.\n"
  answer: true
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example, the POSIX
    spec, an RFC spec, a network protocol spec, or some other requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check the following artifacts for this:
      * bug reports
      * security advisories
      * commit message
      * mailing lists
      * anything else

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: The standard C specification for how "Strings" should be null terminated was
    not upheld.
  answer: true
subsystem:
  question: "What subsystems was the mistake in? These are WITHIN linux kernel\n\nDetermining
    the subsystem is a subjective task. This is to help us group\n similar vulnerabilities,
    so choose a subsystem that other vulnerabilities would be in. \n\nSome areas to
    look for pertinent information:\n  - Bug labels\n  - Directory names\n  - How
    developers refer to an area of the system in comments,\n    commit messages, etc.\n\nLook
    at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get\ndirectory names.
    Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how\nthe bug report was
    tagged.\n\nExample linux kernel subsystems are:\n  * drivers\n  * crypto\n  *
    fs\n  * net\n  * lib\n\nName should be:\n  * all lowercase English letters\n  *
    NOT a specific file\n  * can have digits, and _-@/\n\nCan be multiple subsystems
    involved, in which case you can make it an array\ne.g.\n    name: [\"subsystemA\",
    \"subsystemB\"] # ok\n    name: subsystemA # also ok\n"
  name: fs
  note: all affected files are located in the "fs" directory
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Use this to specify any commits you think are notable in some way, and
    explain why in the note.

    Example interesting commits:
      * Mentioned as a problematic commit in the past
        e.g. "This fixes regression in commit xys"
      * A significant rewrite in the git history
      * Other commits that fixed a similar issue as this vulnerability
      * Anything else you find interesting.

i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)?

    An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: "The impacted feature may have had a tangential relationship with some \nlocalization
    tools, as it is a subset of a collection of tools used \nfor tracing events within
    the file system. The Input and output into\nthe subsystem may require localization,
    but the tracing tool specifically\ndoes not.\n"
sandbox:
  question: |
    Did this vulnerability violate a sandboxing feature that the system
    provides?

    A sandboxing feature is one that allows files, users, or other features
    limited access. Vulnerabilities that violate sandboxes are usually based on
    access control, checking privileges incorrectly, path traversal, and the
    like.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: "The impacted feature deals with event tracing in the file system, and \ndoes
    not inherently restrict access for any file, and so does not\nviolate any sandboxing
    feature.\n"
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: "The subsystem that this vulnerability was found in is used to interact \nwith
    the file system. While the error itself is not a form of IPC, \nthe data involved
    is being taken in from a set of files, and their\ncontents are the trigger that
    could have abused this vulnerability.\n"
discussion:
  question: |
    Was there any discussion surrounding this?

    A discussion can include debates, disputes, or polite talk about how to
    resolve uncertainty.

    Example include:
      * Is this out of our scope?
      * Is this a security?
      * How should we fix this?

    Just because you see multiple comments doesn't mean it's a discussion.
    For example:
      * "Fix line 10". "Ok" is not what we call a discussion
      * "Ping" (reminding people)

    Check the bugs reports, pull requests, and mailing lists archives.

    These answers should be boolean.
      discussed_as_security: true or false
      any_discussion: true or false

    Put any links to disagreements you found in the notes section, or any other
    comment you want to make.
  discussed_as_security: false
  any_discussion: false
  note: |
    No discussion of note, the code that caused the issue was identified and
    removed immidiately.
vouch:
  question: |
    Was there any part of the fix that involved one person vouching for
    another's work?

    This can include:
      * signing off on a commit message
      * mentioning a discussion with a colleague checking the work
      * upvoting a solution on a pull request

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: |
    Three different individuals signed off on the commit that removed the vulnerability:
    Chuck Lever, from Oracle, who was the author of the change
    J. Bruce Fieldsm from Redhat
    and Sasha Levin from Kernel.org
    This information is included as part of the commit message.
stacktrace:
  question: |
    Are there any stacktraces in the bug reports?

    Secondly, if there is a stacktrace, is the fix in the same file that the
    stacktrace points to?

    If there are no stacktraces, then both of these are false - but be sure to
    mention where you checked in the note.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  any_stacktraces: false
  stacktrace_with_fix: false
  note: "No stacktraces are available, apparently because the issue was apparent\nsimply
    from reading the code, so no runs to verify the vulnerability \nwere performed,
    and the solution was obvious, and involved simply \nremoving the offending line.
    as testing for nonexistence is functionally\nimpossible, a test with stack trace
    would be of no value.\n"
forgotten_check:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve adding a forgotten check?

    A "forgotten check" can mean many things. It often manifests as the fix
    inserting an entire if-statement or a conditional to an existing
    if-statement. Or a call to a method that checks something.

    Example of checks can include:
      * null pointer checks
      * check the current role, e.g. root
      * boundary checks for a number
      * consult file permissions
      * check a return value

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: The fix simply involved deleting the method call that introduced the problem.
order_of_operations:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve correcting an order of
    operations?

    This means the fix involves moving code around or changing the order of
    how things are done.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: No order of operations were altered, one line of code was deleted.
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    There can, and usually are, many mistakes behind a vulnerability.

    Remember that mistakes can come in many forms:
    * slip: failing to complete a properly planned step due to inattention
              e.g. wrong key in the ignition
              e.g. using < instead of <=
    * lapse: failing to complete a properly planned step due to memory failure
              e.g. forgetting to put car in reverse before backing up
              e.g. forgetting to check null
    * planning error: error that occurs when the plan is inadequate
              e.g. getting stuck in traffic because you didn't consider the
                   impact of the bridge closing
              e.g. calling the wrong method
              e.g. using a poor design

    These are grey areas, of course. But do your best to analyze the mistakes
    according to this framework.

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Write a thoughtful entry here that people in the software engineering
    industry would find interesting.
  answer: "This mistake appears to have been a slip of the mind, resulting in someone
    \nCommitting a line of code that was both unnecessary, and potentially \nextremely
    harmful. It is worth noting that, despite the simplicity of \nthe mistake, the
    CVSS 3.x severity was still marked as a 7.4, which is \nvery high. small mistakes
    can have reaching consequences. \n"
