  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  A file inside the Linux kernel verifies whether or not a program is allowed to run.
  The file allows the program to make use of pointers in places where it
  should have been using scalars instead. This can lead to pointer leaks (which is when the
  reference to a place in memory is lost and thus cannot be freed or changed)
  and arbitrary code execution. Scalars aren't as prone to this issue because they are usually controlled
  and stored in a fixed memory location. Since pointers point to a specific address in memory and have
  direct access to memory addresses, they can be manipulated to change data outside of
  their intended memory boundaries.

fixes:
- commit: 179d1c5602997fef5a940c6ddcf31212cbfebd14
  note: |
   Manually confirmed. This commit made it so that when a pointer is detected instead
   of a scalar, the method returns false (essentially saying that the program is not
   managing memory correctly).
vcc_instructions: |
  The vulnerability-contributing commits.

  These are found by our tools by traversing the Git Blame history, where we
  determine which commit(s) introduced the functionality.

  Look up these VCC commits and verify that they are not simple refactorings,
  and that they are, in fact introducing the vulnerability into the system.
  Often, introducing the file or function is where the VCC is, but VCCs can be
  anything.

  Place any notes you would like to make in the notes field.
vccs:
- commit: f1174f77b50c94eecaa658fdc56fa69b421de4b8
  note: |
   Vulnerability introduced with this commit on August 7, 2017.
   The verifier treats the pointer as an unknown scalar instead of stopping execution.
   Author Edward Cree made this behavior change because he thought that something
   might be able to be concluded about the result of the pointer.
- commit: b03c9f9fdc37dab81ea04d5dacdc5995d4c224c2
  note: |
   This commit added the tracking of unsigned and signed min/max values to the verifier.
   It is not a direct introduction of the vulnerability, but may have contributed to
   the severity of it.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For code: and fix: - your answer should be boolean.

    For the code_answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix in related directories and determine if and was there were
    unit tests involved for this subsystem.

    For the fix_answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  code: false
  code_answer: |
    Since the mailing list mentions added BPF selftests, there were no tests or
    insufficient tests to discover this vulnerability.
  fix: true
  fix_answer:  |
    The mailing list for this vulnerability mentioned that there were added BPF
    selftests to trigger and test this vulnerability.
    
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please
    explain where you looked.
  answer: |
    There is very little evidence of how this vulnerability was discovered.
    It is highly likely that a related vulnerability lead the developers to
    discover this vulnerability. This is considering
    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1454 which was linked
    to in the mailing list for the vulnerability. The link refers
    to a bug in the range tracking of the BPF system (the same system for which
    this vulnerability was found).
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: true
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

    In systemd, the actually use OZZ Fuzz. If there's a link to it, add it here.

    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: |
    I am saying true for this because the vulnerability is related to how the BPF verifier
    is tracking values when checking that a user-supplied BPF program runs safely/correctly.
    A fuzzer would just have to provide the BPF verifier with a BPF program that incorrectly
    uses pointers instead of scalars, resulting in a denial of service via pointer leaks.
  answer: true
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example, the POSIX
    spec, an RFC spec, a network protocol spec, or some other requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check the following artifacts for this:
      * bug reports
      * security advisories
      * commit message
      * mailing lists
      * anything else

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: |
    There is no mention of a certain specification being violated throughout all major records
    of this vulnerability. CWE 119 was violated but isn't a specification.
  answer: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in? These are WITHIN linux kernel

    Determining the subsystem is a subjective task. This is to help us group
     similar vulnerabilities, so choose a subsystem that other vulnerabilities would be in. Y

    Some areas to look for pertinent information:
      - Bug labels
      - Directory names
      - How developers refer to an area of the system in comments,
        commit messages, etc.

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.

    Example linux kernel subsystems are:
      * drivers
      * crypto
      * fs
      * net
      * lib

    Name should be:
      * all lowercase English letters
      * NOT a specific file
      * can have digits, and _-@/

    Can be multiple subsystems involved, in which case you can make it an array
    e.g.
        name: ["subsystemA", "subsystemB"] # ok
        name: subsystemA # also ok
  name: net
  note: |
    The BPF subsystem is used for packet filtering/analysis and loading custom BPF programs into the kernel.
    This explains why it is placed in the net subsystem.
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Use this to specify any commits you think are notable in some way, and
    explain why in the note.

    Example interesting commits:
      * Mentioned as a problematic commit in the past
        e.g. "This fixes regression in commit xys"
      * A significant rewrite in the git history
      * Other commits that fixed a similar issue as this vulnerability
      * Anything else you find interesting.
  commits:
  - commit: b03c9f9fdc37dab81ea04d5dacdc5995d4c224c2
    note: |
     I find it interesting that the values the BPF verifier could handle was expanded to include both
     signed and unsigned values at around the same time that the commit that caused the vulnerability was made.
     It may signal to yagni. Expanding capability of the BPF verifier and thus what types of BPF programs are
     approved to execute without considering the security implications.
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)?

    An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    The BPF verifier only checks to verify whether or not a BPF program is following
    proper memory allocation principles and is safe for the kernel to execute. It is
    not a feature about internationalization.
sandbox:
  question: |
    Did this vulnerability violate a sandboxing feature that the system
    provides?

    A sandboxing feature is one that allows files, users, or other features
    limited access. Vulnerabilities that violate sandboxes are usually based on
    access control, checking privileges incorrectly, path traversal, and the
    like.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    The vulnerability did not result in a circumventing of any sandboxing or permissions.
    Consider https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-17855/ which shows that authentication
    is not even required in order to exploit the vulnerability.
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    BPF programs when loaded into the Linux kernel do not make use of IPC.
    They are loaded in memory and executed to filter/analyze network traffic.
discussion:
  question: |
    Was there any discussion surrounding this?

    A discussion can include debates, disputes, or polite talk about how to
    resolve uncertainty.

    Example include:
      * Is this out of our scope?
      * Is this a security?
      * How should we fix this?

    Just because you see multiple comments doesn't mean it's a discussion.
    For example:
      * "Fix line 10". "Ok" is not what we call a discussion
      * "Ping" (reminding people)

    Check the bugs reports, pull requests, and mailing lists archives.

    These answers should be boolean.
      discussed_as_security: true or false
      any_discussion: true or false

    Put any links to disagreements you found in the notes section, or any other
    comment you want to make.
  discussed_as_security: false
  any_discussion: true
  note: |
    The following link is to the mailing list where comments added in the actual source code
    show what the programmer's thinking was behind the resolution to the vulnerability.
    https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=179d1c5602997fef5a940c6ddcf31212cbfebd14
vouch:
  question: |
    Was there any part of the fix that involved one person vouching for
    another's work?

    This can include:
      * signing off on a commit message
      * mentioning a discussion with a colleague checking the work
      * upvoting a solution on a pull request

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: |
    The actual commit that fixed the vulnerability was signed off by 2 other people besides the author:
    Signed-off-by: Alexei Starovoitov <ast@kernel.org>
    Signed-off-by: Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>

stacktrace:
  question: |
    Are there any stacktraces in the bug reports?

    Secondly, if there is a stacktrace, is the fix in the same file that the
    stacktrace points to?

    If there are no stacktraces, then both of these are false - but be sure to
    mention where you checked in the note.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  any_stacktraces: false
  stacktrace_with_fix: false
  note: |
    I checked inside of the mailing list in the PoC section: https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/12/21/2
    I checked inside of nvd listing and its additional links: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-17855
forgotten_check:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve adding a forgotten check?

    A "forgotten check" can mean many things. It often manifests as the fix
    inserting an entire if-statement or a conditional to an existing
    if-statement. Or a call to a method that checks something.

    Example of checks can include:
      * null pointer checks
      * check the current role, e.g. root
      * boundary checks for a number
      * consult file permissions
      * check a return value

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    The fix for the vulnerability did not add any extra checks. Both the old code and the new code
    checked to see if a pointer was set for the value in the registery provided. However, the new code
    changed what happened when a pointer was found.
order_of_operations:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve correcting an order of
    operations?

    This means the fix involves moving code around or changing the order of
    how things are done.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    I looked directly at the code for the fix and did not find any change in order of operations.
    The value of what the function returned was changed.
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

    note: |
     The BPF verifier receives input from the user indirectly. It has to verify user-created
     BPF programs. If the program makes use of pointers in areas where it should make use of
     scalars, it could result in this vulnerability.

    note: |
     The commit that introduced this vulnerability was caused by a developer that thought something
     could be concluded still about a pointer's value when treated as a unknown scalar.
  complex_inputs:
    applies: true
    note: |
     The attacker can essential make use of complex inputs to access arbitrary memory locations.
mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    There can, and usually are, many mistakes behind a vulnerability.

    Remember that mistakes can come in many forms:
    * slip: failing to complete a properly planned step due to inattention
              e.g. wrong key in the ignition
              e.g. using < instead of <=
    * lapse: failing to complete a properly planned step due to memory failure
              e.g. forgetting to put car in reverse before backing up
              e.g. forgetting to check null
    * planning error: error that occurs when the plan is inadequate
              e.g. getting stuck in traffic because you didn't consider the
                   impact of the bridge closing
              e.g. calling the wrong method
              e.g. using a poor design

    These are grey areas, of course. But do your best to analyze the mistakes
    according to this framework.

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Write a thoughtful entry here that people in the software engineering
    industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    Vulnerability CVE-2017-17855 was the result of a planning error which led to a coding mistake.
    The developer who adjusted the BPF verifier so that it would accept and treat pointers as unknown
    scalars did not consider the full effects of his actions. He was too focused on the possibility
    of the BPF verifier gaining more knowledge about the pointer.
