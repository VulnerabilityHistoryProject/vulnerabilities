  =================
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  Indirect branch speculation allows for Spectre v2 attacks, also
  called indirect branch poisoning. These attacks, and by extension this
  vulnerability, allow for user-space programs to access full system memory and
  gain access to sensitive information or passwords across running programs. An
  option in the Linux kernel force-disables indirect branch speculation to
  prevent these attacks. A hole in force-disabling allowed it to be re-enabled
  in an invisible way, where branch speculation would be reported as
  force-disabled even when it was enabled.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For code: and fix: - your answer should be boolean.

    For the code_answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix in related directories and determine if and was there were
    unit tests involved for this subsystem.

    For the fix_answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  code: false
  code_answer: |
    A unit test for this vulnerability could not be found. The Linux Test Project
    also does not have tests for this vulnerability, but does have checks for Meltdown,
    a related vulnerability.
  fix: false
  fix_answer:
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please
    explain where you looked.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was discovered and reported to the Linux
    kernel mailing list by Google engineer Anthony Steinhauser on 2020-06-09, who
    quoted concerns about implications for Chromium's security due to this
    problem. It is unclear exactly how he discovered the vulnerability initially.
    News articles mentioning that this vulnerability was found were released the
    same day.
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: true
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

    In systemd, the actually use OZZ Fuzz. If there's a link to it, add it here.

    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: |
    Due to the contextual nature of the bug and the conditions needed to detect and
    exploit the vulnerability, it is unlikely that an automated tool would have
    detected this vulnerability.
  answer: false
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example, the POSIX
    spec, an RFC spec, a network protocol spec, or some other requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check the following artifacts for this:
      * bug reports
      * security advisories
      * commit message
      * mailing lists
      * anything else

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: |
    When the first commit adding the affected function was made,
    it was added with documentation with how the function should work.
    This documentation stated that force disabling should prevent the
    speculative branching feature from being enabled again, however the
    implementation did not enforce this.
  answer: true
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in? These are WITHIN linux kernel

    Determining the subsystem is a subjective task. This is to help us group
     similar vulnerabilities, so choose a subsystem that other vulnerabilities would be in. Y

    Some areas to look for pertinent information:
      - Bug labels
      - Directory names
      - How developers refer to an area of the system in comments,
        commit messages, etc.

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.

    Example linux kernel subsystems are:
      * drivers
      * crypto
      * fs
      * net
      * lib

    Name should be:
      * all lowercase English letters
      * NOT a specific file
      * can have digits, and _-@/

    Can be multiple subsystems involved, in which case you can make it an array
    e.g.
        name: ["subsystemA", "subsystemB"] # ok
        name: subsystemA # also ok
  name: cpu
  note: |
    Involved with code meant to interface between OS-level processes and the CPU hardware.
    Exists in a subsystem of the kernel's cpu system called "Userspace API".
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Use this to specify any commits you think are notable in some way, and
    explain why in the note.

    Example interesting commits:
      * Mentioned as a problematic commit in the past
        e.g. "This fixes regression in commit xys"
      * A significant rewrite in the git history
      * Other commits that fixed a similar issue as this vulnerability
      * Anything else you find interesting.
  commits:
  - commit: 21998a351512eba4ed5969006f0c55882d995ada
    note: |
      This commit from 1 month before adds several conditions to the affected
      if-statement. These appear to help mitigate related potential vulnerabilities,
      but it was authored a month before it was committed on the same day as the fix.
  - commit:
    note:
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)?

    An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    This vulnerability originates in hardware and is exploited by setting a flag
    in the kernel. These inputs shouldn't involve internationalization.
sandbox:
  question: |
    Did this vulnerability violate a sandboxing feature that the system
    provides?

    A sandboxing feature is one that allows files, users, or other features
    limited access. Vulnerabilities that violate sandboxes are usually based on
    access control, checking privileges incorrectly, path traversal, and the
    like.o

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: |
    The Spectre v2 vulnerability allows user-space programs to read the memory of
    other user-space programs running in parallel, violating sandboxing at the
    hardware level.
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    The affected function was responsible for getting and setting the value of a
    system-level variable. This variable acted as a signal to the processor to
    behave in a "safe" way. This is not exactly inter-process.
discussion:
  question: |
    Was there any discussion surrounding this?

    A discussion can include debates, disputes, or polite talk about how to
    resolve uncertainty.

    Example include:
      * Is this out of our scope?
      * Is this a security?
      * How should we fix this?

    Just because you see multiple comments doesn't mean it's a discussion.
    For example:
      * "Fix line 10". "Ok" is not what we call a discussion
      * "Ping" (reminding people)

    Check the bugs reports, pull requests, and mailing lists archives.

    These answers should be boolean.
      discussed_as_security: true or false
      any_discussion: true or false

    Put any links to disagreements you found in the notes section, or any other
    comment you want to make.
  discussed_as_security: false
  any_discussion: false
  note: |
    No discussion was found besides the initial notice to the team. Because
    Steinhauser's notice also included a fixing commit, there was likely not need
    for discussion.
vouch:
  question: |
    Was there any part of the fix that involved one person vouching for
    another's work?

    This can include:
      * signing off on a commit message
      * mentioning a discussion with a colleague checking the work
      * upvoting a solution on a pull request

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: |
    Thomas Gleixner was involved with, signed off on and was ultimately the one
    merging and approving the fixes around this vulnerability. He signed off on
    Anthony Steinhauser's original email and commits with fixes to the vulnerability.
    Signed-off-by: Anthony Steinhauser <asteinhauser@google.com>
    Signed-off-by: Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>
stacktrace:
  question: |
    Are there any stacktraces in the bug reports?

    Secondly, if there is a stacktrace, is the fix in the same file that the
    stacktrace points to?

    If there are no stacktraces, then both of these are false - but be sure to
    mention where you checked in the note.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  any_stacktraces: false
  stacktrace_with_fix: false
  note: |
    The bug was reported with a fix, and no stacktraces were included.
forgotten_check:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve adding a forgotten check?

    A "forgotten check" can mean many things. It often manifests as the fix
    inserting an entire if-statement or a conditional to an existing
    if-statement. Or a call to a method that checks something.

    Example of checks can include:
      * null pointer checks
      * check the current role, e.g. root
      * boundary checks for a number
      * consult file permissions
      * check a return value

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: |
    The fix for this vulnerability was to add a missing conditional check to an
    existing if-statement.
order_of_operations:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve correcting an order of
    operations?

    This means the fix involves moving code around or changing the order of
    how things are done.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    This was a case of an entirely missing check, and every part of the relevant
    conditional is OR'd together, so order of operations does not apply
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    There can, and usually are, many mistakes behind a vulnerability.

    Remember that mistakes can come in many forms:
    * slip: failing to complete a properly planned step due to inattention
              e.g. wrong key in the ignition
              e.g. using < instead of <=
    * lapse: failing to complete a properly planned step due to memory failure
              e.g. forgetting to put car in reverse before backing up
              e.g. forgetting to check null
    * planning error: error that occurs when the plan is inadequate
              e.g. getting stuck in traffic because you didn't consider the
                   impact of the bridge closing
              e.g. calling the wrong method
              e.g. using a poor design

    These are grey areas, of course. But do your best to analyze the mistakes
    according to this framework.

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Write a thoughtful entry here that people in the software engineering
    industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability stems from a lapse during the initial
    implementation of the prctl() function for checking and changing
    the status of indirect branch speculation. When the function was
    written, it had a force disable in mind but a check for this value was forgotten.
