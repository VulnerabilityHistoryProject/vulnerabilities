  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: "CVE-2021-3490 was a vulnerability that resulted from eBPF not doing
  proper bounds \ntracking after a bitwise operation was performed (AND, OR, or XOR).
  eBPF is a \nsandboxing tool that allows programs to be run in an operating system
  kernel. \nHowever, due to the fact that the Linux kernel did not properly update
  32-bit \nbounds, an AND, OR, or XOR could lead to out of bounds reads or writes,
  which in \nturn could lead to arbitrary code execution. This is a very high severity
  issue. \n"

    looked \nfor a bug report and found one on both bugzilla.redhat.com and bugzilla.suse.com
    \nand neither have any mention of how the bug was found. I was unable to locate
    a \nbug report on bugzilla.kernel.com. The bugzilla.suse.com did have a brief
    \nconversation discussion the location of the official upstream fix, but no mention
    \nof the original bug discovery. \n"
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: true
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

    In systemd, the actually use OZZ Fuzz. If there's a link to it, add it here.

    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: "It is plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered this. The
    \nvulnerability was related to a integer overflow, which an automated tool, such
    \nas a fuzzer, excels at finding. \n"
  answer: true
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example, the POSIX
    spec, an RFC spec, a network protocol spec, or some other requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check the following artifacts for this:
      * bug reports
      * security advisories
      * commit message
      * mailing lists
      * anything else

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: "The was no mention of violation of specification in any of the bug reports,
    \ncommit messages, or mailing list archives. \n"
  answer: false
subsystem:
  question: "What subsystems was the mistake in? These are WITHIN linux kernel\n\nDetermining
    the subsystem is a subjective task. This is to help us group\n similar vulnerabilities,
    so choose a subsystem that other vulnerabilities would \n be in. Y\n\nSome areas
    to look for pertinent information:\n  - Bug labels\n  - Directory names\n  - How
    developers refer to an area of the system in comments,\n    commit messages, etc.\n\nLook
    at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get\ndirectory names.
    Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how\nthe bug report was
    tagged.\n\nExample linux kernel subsystems are:\n  * drivers\n  * crypto\n  *
    fs\n  * net\n  * lib\n\nName should be:\n  * all lowercase English letters\n  *
    NOT a specific file\n  * can have digits, and _-@/\n\nCan be multiple subsystems
    involved, in which case you can make it an array\ne.g.\n    name: [\"subsystemA\",
    \"subsystemB\"] # ok\n    name: subsystemA # also ok\n"
  name:
  - bpf
  note: "The vulnerability was discoverd inside of the bpf subsystem. This makes sense,
    \nas the error is associated with ePBF.\n"
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Use this to specify any commits you think are notable in some way, and
    explain why in the note.

    Example interesting commits:
      * Mentioned as a problematic commit in the past
        e.g. "This fixes regression in commit xys"
      * A significant rewrite in the git history

      * Anything else you find interesting.
  commits:
  - commit: 5b9fbeb75b6a98955f628e205ac26689bcb1383e
    note: |
      Fixed issues with scalar32_min_max_or bounds tracking using 64 bit
      registers instead of 32 bit. This is the second bounds issue related
      to this function fixed in a two month period.
  - commit: 41f70fe0649dddf02046315dc566e06da5a2dc91
    note: |
      Added tests for bounds checking related to the alu32 bit operations,
      which the vulnerability exploited as incorrect. These test are not
      very exhaustive.
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)?

    An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: "This vulnerability has nothing to do with internationalization. It is unrelated
    \nto translations, locales, etc. The root cause was an integer overflow, which
    not \nan internationalization related issue. \n"
sandbox:
  question: |
    Did this vulnerability violate a sandboxing feature that the system
    provides?

    A sandboxing feature is one that allows files, users, or other features
    limited access. Vulnerabilities that violate sandboxes are usually based on
    access control, checking privileges incorrectly, path traversal, and the
    like.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: "The vulnerability was center around eBPF, which is a Linux kernel tool for
    \nrunning programs in a sandbox. The vulnerability allowed the users to exploit
    a \nbug in the sandbox to gain higher privileges and code in the context of the
    \nkernel. \n"
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: "This vulnerability was isolated to a single function call within the eBPF
    code \nthat did not make use of inter-process communication.\n"
discussion:
  question: |
    Was there any discussion surrounding this?

    A discussion can include debates, disputes, or polite talk about how to
    resolve uncertainty.

    Example include:
      * Is this out of our scope?
      * Is this a security?
      * How should we fix this?

    Just because you see multiple comments doesn't mean it's a discussion.
    For example:
      * "Fix line 10". "Ok" is not what we call a discussion
      * "Ping" (reminding people)

    Check the bugs reports, pull requests, and mailing lists archives.

    These answers should be boolean.
      discussed_as_security: true or false
      any_discussion: true or false

    Put any links to disagreements you found in the notes section, or any other
    comment you want to make.
  discussed_as_security: false
  any_discussion: false
  note: "From what I could find, there was no discussion or debate around how the
    issue \nshould be resolved. The issues of out-of-bounds writes, reads, and improper
    input \nvalidation, while very sever, also have straight forward solutions. It
    seems that \neveryone was in agreement that the solution was to add proper input
    validation to \nensure the numbers stay within its bounds. \n"
vouch:
  question: "Was there any part of the fix that involved one person vouching for\nanother's
    work?\n\nThis can include:\n  * signing off on a commit message\n  * mentioning
    a discussion with a colleague checking the work\n  * upvoting a solution on a
    pull request\n\nAnswer must be true or false.\nWrite a note about how you came
    to the conclusions you did, regardless of what \nyour answer was.\n"
  answer: true
  note: 'All commits involving a fix involved at least one other person approving
    the work.

    '
stacktrace:
  question: |
    Are there any stacktraces in the bug reports?

    Secondly, if there is a stacktrace, is the fix in the same file that the
    stacktrace points to?

    If there are no stacktraces, then both of these are false - but be sure to
    mention where you checked in the note.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  any_stacktraces: false
  stacktrace_with_fix: false
  note: "There are no stack traces that show the error. However, there are examples
    of \nwhat inputs the system produces in both the incorrect and correct state.
    \n"
forgotten_check:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve adding a forgotten check?

    A "forgotten check" can mean many things. It often manifests as the fix
    inserting an entire if-statement or a conditional to an existing
    if-statement. Or a call to a method that checks something.

    Example of checks can include:
      * null pointer checks
      * check the current role, e.g. root
      * boundary checks for a number
      * consult file permissions
      * check a return value

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: "The solution involved adding a boundary check to the number to ensure that
    it \nfalls within the bounds of a 32 bit integer. Without these check, there could
    be \nout-of-bounds read and writing, leading to arbitrary code execution.\n"
order_of_operations:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve correcting an order of
    operations?

    This means the fix involves moving code around or changing the order of
    how things are done.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: "The order of operations stays the same, there is just an additional step.
    \n"
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    There can, and usually are, many mistakes behind a vulnerability.

    Remember that mistakes can come in many forms:
    * slip: failing to complete a properly planned step due to inattention
              e.g. wrong key in the ignition
              e.g. using < instead of <=
    * lapse: failing to complete a properly planned step due to memory failure
              e.g. forgetting to put car in reverse before backing up
              e.g. forgetting to check null
    * planning error: error that occurs when the plan is inadequate
              e.g. getting stuck in traffic because you didn't consider the
                   impact of the bridge closing
              e.g. calling the wrong method
              e.g. using a poor design

    These are grey areas, of course. But do your best to analyze the mistakes
    according to this framework.

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Write a thoughtful entry here that people in the software engineering
    industry would find interesting.
  answer: "CVE-2021-3490 is a lesson in not trusting user input. The core of the issue
    \narose as a result of a seemly harmless input. But, harmless as it may look,
    if \nnot properly validated, it could led to arbitrary code execution by a bad
    actor. \nOut-of-bound reads and writes may be easy issues to correct with simple
    checks \nand validations, but if you trust that the data will always look a certain
    way, \nyou may justify not including such checks. \n\nThe biggest mistake that
    led to this vulnerability was trusting the inputs to the \nsystem and thinking
    they did not need these simple checks. Once it was discovered \nthat a malicious
    input could be fed into the system, it was only then that they \nchecks were put
    in place. If the developers followed the principle of distrusting \ninputs, this
    vulnerability never would have occurred. \n\nLooking at the relevant CWE entries,
    CWE-20 (Improper Input Validation), CWE-125\n(Out-of-bounds Read), and CWE-787(Out-of_bounds
    Writes), the mitigations that \nthey suggest were utilized in the patch that fixed
    CVE-2021-3490. Specially, \nCWE-20 and CWE-125 mention assuming all input is malicious.
    They suggest adopting \nan \"accept know good\" strategy on the input. The Linux
    developers took a slightly \ndifferent approach and simple only return known good
    outputs. Despite not being \nexactly what the CWE recommends, it is functional
    the same in this case and \nserves to mitigate the vulnerability. \n"
