  =================
  ===YAML Primer===
  =================
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description:
  When using recvfrom() or recvmsg() to receive data from an AX.25 socket, the
  socker driver did not properly zero-initialize the source address struct
  before copying it to userspace, leaking uninitialized padding bytes containing
  kernel stack data.

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please
    explain where you looked.
  answer: |
    According to the original patch submission
    (https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg231967.html), the author was motivated
    to audit the recvmsg implementation of various protocols because of another patch
    included in grsecurity, a combination of out-of-tree patches intended
    to harden the Linux kernel. Unfortunately grsecurity does not have a publicly
    available git repository to trace back to the original discovery.
    The author is not a Google employee.
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: true

autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

    In systemd, the actually use OZZ Fuzz. If there's a link to it, add it here.

    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer: true
  note: |
    A generic fuzzer written to fuzz `recvfrom()` or `recvmsg()` should be able to
    trigger the bug, as long as the fuzzer elects to receive the source address.
    A kernel built with MemorySanitizer should be able to detect the uninitialize
    memory reads/writes, although it'd be a bit difficult because the uninitialized
    data is in the normally unaccessible padding bytes. The fuzzer might
    have to manually access the padding bytes to trigger MemorySanitizer.
    
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example, the POSIX
    spec, an RFC spec, a network protocol spec, or some other requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check the following artifacts for this:
      * bug reports
      * security advisories
      * commit message
      * mailing lists
      * anything else

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer: false
  note: |
    No violation of specifications, the socket driver simply neglected to
    zero-initialize a kernel structure before copying it to userspace.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in? These are WITHIN linux kernel

    Determining the subsystem is a subjective task. This is to help us group
     similar vulnerabilities, so choose a subsystem that other vulnerabilities would be in. Y

    Some areas to look for pertinent information:
      - Bug labels
      - Directory names
      - How developers refer to an area of the system in comments,
        commit messages, etc.

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.

    Example linux kernel subsystems are:
      * drivers
      * crypto
      * fs
      * net
      * lib

    Name should be:
      * all lowercase English letters
      * NOT a specific file
      * can have digits, and _-@/

    Can be multiple subsystems involved, in which case you can make it an array
    e.g.
        name: ["subsystemA", "subsystemB"] # ok
        name: subsystemA # also ok
  name: net
  note:

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Use this to specify any commits you think are notable in some way, and
    explain why in the note.

    Example interesting commits:
      * Mentioned as a problematic commit in the past
        e.g. "This fixes regression in commit xys"
      * A significant rewrite in the git history
      * Other commits that fixed a similar issue as this vulnerability
      * Anything else you find interesting.
  commits:

    note: Commit where the patchset containing this patch is merged into the main kernel repository

i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)?

    An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note:
    The impacted feature is the AX.25 socket driver, which implements the AX.25
    protocol (data link layer over amateur radio). This is not related to any
    i18n features.

sandbox:
  question: |
    Did this vulnerability violate a sandboxing feature that the system
    provides?

    A sandboxing feature is one that allows files, users, or other features
    limited access. Vulnerabilities that violate sandboxes are usually based on
    access control, checking privileges incorrectly, path traversal, and the
    like.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: |
    The kernel leaks data from kernel space to userspace, which are normally
    two separate memory spaces.

ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: |
    The bug involves copying memory from a privileged memory space (kernel space)
    to a non-priveleged space (user space), such that the memory might contain
    data in the priveleged space.

discussion:
  question: |
    Was there any discussion surrounding this?

    A discussion can include debates, disputes, or polite talk about how to
    resolve uncertainty.

    Example include:
      * Is this out of our scope?
      * Is this a security?
      * How should we fix this?

    Just because you see multiple comments doesn't mean it's a discussion.
    For example:
      * "Fix line 10". "Ok" is not what we call a discussion
      * "Ping" (reminding people)

    Check the bugs reports, pull requests, and mailing lists archives.

    These answers should be boolean.
      discussed_as_security: true or false
      any_discussion: true or false

    Put any links to disagreements you found in the notes section, or any other
    comment you want to make.
  discussed_as_security: true
  any_discussion: true

vouch:
  question: |
    Was there any part of the fix that involved one person vouching for
    another's work?

    This can include:
      * signing off on a commit message
      * mentioning a discussion with a colleague checking the work
      * upvoting a solution on a pull request

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note:
    Patch was initially merged into the netdev tree by David S. Miller <davem@davemloft.net>,
    then the patch finds its way into the various Linux kernel trees (master, -stable, ...)

stacktrace:
  question: |
    Are there any stacktraces in the bug reports?

    Secondly, if there is a stacktrace, is the fix in the same file that the
    stacktrace points to?

    If there are no stacktraces, then both of these are false - but be sure to
    mention where you checked in the note.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  any_stacktraces: false
  stacktrace_with_fix: false
  note: |
    No stack traces were included in any commit messages or emails.

forgotten_check:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve adding a forgotten check?

    A "forgotten check" can mean many things. It often manifests as the fix
    inserting an entire if-statement or a conditional to an existing
    if-statement. Or a call to a method that checks something.

    Example of checks can include:
      * null pointer checks
      * check the current role, e.g. root
      * boundary checks for a number
      * consult file permissions
      * check a return value

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    The bug does not involve a forgotten check.

order_of_operations:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve correcting an order of
    operations?

    This means the fix involves moving code around or changing the order of
    how things are done.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note:
    The bug does not involve correcting an order of operations.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note: |
      Allocating a stack variable on C without initializing it is dangerous because
      the variable contains uninitialized data. A developer should always initialize

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    There can, and usually are, many mistakes behind a vulnerability.

    Remember that mistakes can come in many forms:
    * slip: failing to complete a properly planned step due to inattention
              e.g. wrong key in the ignition
              e.g. using < instead of <=
    * lapse: failing to complete a properly planned step due to memory failure
              e.g. forgetting to put car in reverse before backing up
              e.g. forgetting to check null
    * planning error: error that occurs when the plan is inadequate
              e.g. getting stuck in traffic because you didn't consider the
                   impact of the bridge closing
              e.g. calling the wrong method
              e.g. using a poor design

    These are grey areas, of course. But do your best to analyze the mistakes
    according to this framework.

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Write a thoughtful entry here that people in the software engineering
    industry would find interesting.
  answer:
    A C struct might contain zero or more padding bytes, to ensure that struct members
    are aligned to their natural alignment. These padding bytes are not normally
    accessible, and even when all members in a struct is fully initialized, the
    padding bytes will contain undefiend values.

    The fault lies in the fact that the kernel copies the source address struct
    from kernel space to user space, it does not copy it member-by-member, but it
    treats whole struct as a block of memory and copy it wholesale. This will also copy
    the padding bytes, which might contain random stack data in kernel space.
    Technically speaking, this is a language violation, and it's unsafe to do so
    anyway, because the padding scheme beween the source and destination struct
    might be different, ...

    Following the framework, this can be classified as a planning error. The original
    author who decided to wholesale copy the struct instead of doing it member-by-member
    probably did it as a performance optimization, without considering the implications.
    Other authors decide to follow the same path without consideration to what could
    go wrong.
