description: |
  There was a failure to check for SSID size before copying memory into a buffer.
  This could lead to attackers triggering a buffer overflow attack since the size 
  of the data was not properly being checked. Arbitrary code execution would also 
  be possible since it is a buffer overflow attack. For example an attacker could modify 
  function pointers to have the return address of a function point to the attacker's code.

autodiscoverable:
  note: |
    A tool could have determined that buffer overflow was possible such as 
    a fuzzer trying to pass in a large enough buffer to the driver code. 
  answer: true
specification:
  note: |
      There is no written specification for the Linux Kernel to check memory sizes.
      It would be up to the developers to make sure their code would be able to 
      handle certain edge cases such as a buffer being too large.
  answer: false
subsystem:
  name: ["drivers", "net", "wireless"]
  note: |
    The directory structure is drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex. This vulnerability
    is related to a networking driver for wireless communications.

i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)?

    An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    Although SSID can have non-English characters that could be larger than 1 byte,
    this vulnerability wouldn't check for SSID length regardless of the characters used.
sandbox:
  answer: false
  note: |
    This was not a permissions or privilege issue related vulnerability. User input 
    was just not being validated completely before being used.
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: |
    This vulnerability had to do with a buffer overflow vulnerability in a 
    wireless networking driver.
discussion:

  note: |
    According to lore.kernel.org, the only post was from Zhang Xiaohui 
    about the issue, which was a posted fix with no replies.
vouch:
  answer: false
  note: |
    Based on the git commit, it was signed off by Zhang Xiaohui and Kalle Valo, but
    they were the ones that authored the commit in the first place, so no person outside 
    the fix contribution vouched for the code before it got merged.
stacktrace:

  stacktrace_with_fix: false
  note: |
    There was no stacktrace provided when the vulnerability was reported
forgotten_check:
  answer: true
  note: |
    The fix involved checking the length of the input before attempting to 
    use the input in a memcpy call.
order_of_operations:
  answer: false
  note: |
    Code needed to be added to resolve this vulnerability. No code had to be 
    rearranged or re-ordered.

mistakes:
  answer: |
    There was a lapse because the developer introducing the vulnerability forgot 
    to check the size of the SSID input before copying it into a buffer. The 
    mitigation was to bounds check the user input before processing it which is 
    a implementation phase mitigation according to CWE 120, where the buffer is 
    validated.

- 120
