  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  The Linux kernel has mechanisms built in for handling networking.  In the IPv6
  system there is a limitation on size of a network packet.  When a packet gets too
  large, it is fragmented into smaller packets.  To keep them from becoming separated,
  the packets are given a matching ID.  In the past, this ID incremented by one
  everytime this happened, meaning that one could count the exact number of packets
  handled in between two fragments.  This was considered a security leak, so the Linux
  kernel added a more sophisticated mechanism.  It stored the IP address in a hash
  table, and stored an incrementing counter at that key.  Whenever a packet ID was
  needed, it would add a random number to the counter and use the result as the ID.  To
  make this more unpredictable, a change was made so that this random number was
  based on the number of milliseconds since the time of last access at that IP hash.
  However, as with any hash table, collisions could be forced.  Using these and seeing
  what fragment IDs were generated, attackers were able to read secret messages
  transmitted from computers that were supposed to be on a secure network.  The internal
  state of the counter was enough to exfiltrate secret information over a network,
  using the state of the server as a message box.  The mechanism of the exploit was
  simple, to signal a 1, the locked down computer would send a large number of packets
  over an interval, causing this counter to increment greatly.  To signal a 0, it
  would send no packets, causing the counter to remain the same.  When a computer on
  the outside (colliding with the internal computer's IP address) tried to get a new
  packet ID, it would see how much it had changed by since it last sent a packet,
  indicating if a 1 or 0 was intended.  To resolve this issue as well as similar collision
  issues, the Linux kernel developers replaced any internal state here with a random
  number, ensuring that the packet ID is truly random.  At first, they just increased
  the size of the internal hash table to make finding collisions harder, but since
  IPv6 addresses are so easily available in large numbers, they also decided on the
  random mechanism to take any precictability out of packet IDs.

  answer: |
    Amit Klein, at Bar Ilan University, submitted a 37 page paper describing how
    he used internal counters within the Linux kernel IPv6 modules to exfiltrate data
    out of a secure network.  He first notified the Linux kernel developers, and then
    published the findings after the fix was in.

  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: false
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

    In systemd, the actually use OZZ Fuzz. If there's a link to it, add it here.

    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: |
    Absolutely not, this was a very advanced and esoteric project,
      and it required clever strategizing to even find something to do
      with this counter.
  answer: false
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example, the POSIX
    spec, an RFC spec, a network protocol spec, or some other requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check the following artifacts for this:
      * bug reports
      * security advisories
      * commit message
      * mailing lists
      * anything else

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  note: |
    No, and many other operating systems have more predictable methods
      for generating fragment IDs.
  answer:
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in? These are WITHIN linux kernel

    Determining the subsystem is a subjective task. This is to help us group
     similar vulnerabilities, so choose a subsystem that other vulnerabilities would be in. Y

    Some areas to look for pertinent information:
      - Bug labels
      - Directory names
      - How developers refer to an area of the system in comments,
        commit messages, etc.

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.

    Example linux kernel subsystems are:
      * drivers
      * crypto
      * fs
      * net
      * lib

    Name should be:
      * all lowercase English letters
      * NOT a specific file
      * can have digits, and _-@/

    Can be multiple subsystems involved, in which case you can make it an array
    e.g.
        name: ["subsystemA", "subsystemB"] # ok
        name: subsystemA # also ok
  name: net
  note: Specifically in the IPv6 system.
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Use this to specify any commits you think are notable in some way, and
    explain why in the note.

    Example interesting commits:
      * Mentioned as a problematic commit in the past
        e.g. "This fixes regression in commit xys"
      * A significant rewrite in the git history
      * Other commits that fixed a similar issue as this vulnerability
      * Anything else you find interesting.
  commits:
  - commit: aa6dd211e4b1dde9d5dc25d699d35f789ae7eeba
    note: |
      This doesn't actually resolve the issue at all, it just makes
        it more tedious to exploit it.  To be fair, very much more tedious
        in cases where the hash table is very large.
  - commit:
    note:
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)?

    An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: No, it was all numeric.
sandbox:
  question: |
    Did this vulnerability violate a sandboxing feature that the system
    provides?

    A sandboxing feature is one that allows files, users, or other features
    limited access. Vulnerabilities that violate sandboxes are usually based on
    access control, checking privileges incorrectly, path traversal, and the
    like.

    Answer should be true or false
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: No, this was normal behavior.
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: No, it was just basic tracking and manipulation of global state.
discussion:
  question: |
    Was there any discussion surrounding this?

    A discussion can include debates, disputes, or polite talk about how to
    resolve uncertainty.

    Example include:
      * Is this out of our scope?
      * Is this a security?
      * How should we fix this?

    Just because you see multiple comments doesn't mean it's a discussion.
    For example:
      * "Fix line 10". "Ok" is not what we call a discussion
      * "Ping" (reminding people)

    Check the bugs reports, pull requests, and mailing lists archives.

    These answers should be boolean.
      discussed_as_security: true or false
      any_discussion: true or false

    Put any links to disagreements you found in the notes section, or any other
    comment you want to make.
  discussed_as_security: false
  any_discussion: false
  note: |
    This was explicitly proved in the paper and the changes were not questioned.
vouch:
  question: |
    Was there any part of the fix that involved one person vouching for
    another's work?

    This can include:
      * signing off on a commit message
      * mentioning a discussion with a colleague checking the work
      * upvoting a solution on a pull request

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of what your answer was.
  answer: true
  note: Yes, it was signed off on by Jakub Kicinski and reviewed by Eric Dumazet from Google.
stacktrace:
  question: |
    Are there any stacktraces in the bug reports?

    Secondly, if there is a stacktrace, is the fix in the same file that the
    stacktrace points to?

    If there are no stacktraces, then both of these are false - but be sure to
    mention where you checked in the note.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  any_stacktraces: false
  stacktrace_with_fix: false
  note: No, it would not be relevant.
forgotten_check:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve adding a forgotten check?

    A "forgotten check" can mean many things. It often manifests as the fix
    inserting an entire if-statement or a conditional to an existing
    if-statement. Or a call to a method that checks something.

    Example of checks can include:
      * null pointer checks
      * check the current role, e.g. root
      * boundary checks for a number
      * consult file permissions
      * check a return value

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: No, no check was added.
order_of_operations:
  question: |
    Does the fix for the vulnerability involve correcting an order of
    operations?

    This means the fix involves moving code around or changing the order of
    how things are done.

    Answer must be true or false.
    Write a note about how you came to the conclusions you did, regardless of
    what your answer was.
  answer: false
  note: No, no order of operations were adjusted.
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true

    note: |
      The ID generation algorithm was not truly random, just noisy and hard to
      garner information from.  They also relied on hashing a number of things from
      the packet, but these were still writable and could force a collision.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    There can, and usually are, many mistakes behind a vulnerability.

    Remember that mistakes can come in many forms:
    * slip: failing to complete a properly planned step due to inattention
              e.g. wrong key in the ignition
              e.g. using < instead of <=
    * lapse: failing to complete a properly planned step due to memory failure
              e.g. forgetting to put car in reverse before backing up
              e.g. forgetting to check null
    * planning error: error that occurs when the plan is inadequate
              e.g. getting stuck in traffic because you didn't consider the
                   impact of the bridge closing
              e.g. calling the wrong method
              e.g. using a poor design

    These are grey areas, of course. But do your best to analyze the mistakes
    according to this framework.

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Write a thoughtful entry here that people in the software engineering
    industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    It is very understandable that packet IDs were not considered as a means to
    abuse Linux systems.  In fact, the vulnerability exploiting them was very elaborate
    and unexpected.  However, any means by which one computer can effect global state
    of a server in a way by which another computer can read it should be seen as a
    channel for secret communication, even if unlikely.  The fact that kernel developers
    had to go to increasingly obfuscated means for generating a packet ID should have
    been a sign that they should have gone for true randomness from the beginning,
    since any obfuscation can be unobfuscated with enough effort.  Starting at
    incrementing IDs, then hashing with a table and timestamps, then a larger table, these are
    all just obfuscation methods to make it harder, but not impossible, to get
    information from this field.  With randomness, all information is lost which was always
    the goal.
