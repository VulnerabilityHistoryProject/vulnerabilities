description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  In Tomcat, web applications are normally allowed access to a particular work
  directory on the user's system. The applications are granted both read and write
  permissions to that directory so that they are able to use temporary files. Tomcat
  has an attribute that dictates the location of that directory. To prevent web
  applications from changing the work directory, they should not be able to modify
  that attribute. However, as a result of this vulnerability, applications were
  able to change that attribute, which meant that malicious web applications
  could read and write to any area on the user's file system.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: |
    Test cases for the file could not be found in any of the higher-level
    directories. Likewise, the commit that provided the fix did not include
    any changes to any testing files.

  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found.
    * Answer in longform below in "answer"
    * Fill in the date in YYYY-MM-DD
    * If it's clear that the vulnerability was discovered by a contest,
      fill in the name there.
    * The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you
    may leave the entries blank except for "answer", BUT please write down
    where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    According to the fix notes, the vulnerability was discovered by the
    Tomcat security team. No other information regarding how it was discovered
    was disclosed.

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
    Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this
    section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    There was only one commit between the VCC and the fix. That commit changed
    a single line of code in a JavaDoc.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The main mistake that lead to this vulnerability was a lack of testing.
    The author was aware that it was necessary to set the work directory
    attribute to read-only. However, due to the way it was implemented,
    the actual code that set the attribute to read-only was ineffective.
    A fairly simple test should have been able to catch this issue.
    One of the potential mitigations for CWE-269 is to carefully manage
    the handling of privileges. The fix created for this vulnerability
    seems to employ this mitigation in a proper way.

    Fortunately, this vulnerability had fairly low impact and exploitability
    scores. Confidentiality and availability were not affected whatsoever as
    a result of this vulnerability. However, integrity was affected since
    an attacker was able to modify the user's files. There were no known
    reports of this vulnerability being exploited. Since the Tomcat security
    team discovered this issue themselves, they were able to fix it before
    it became a bigger issue.
