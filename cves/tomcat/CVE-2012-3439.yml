description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: | 
  Due to several issues authentication could be defeated. First, rather than 
  server random identification numbers or "nonces" being tracked, the 
  software tracked client side ID numbers. This allowed valid IDs to be 
  reused with unauthenticated requests. Secondly, if a valid session ID for 
  the user was given, authentication would then be bypassed. Finally, if an ID 
  number became stale and needed to be rerolled, a user's username and 
  password were not checked before sending a notification of this.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: |
    Automated unit tests were not involved in initially missing this 
    vulnerability. There were unit tests for this module, but they were not 
    looking for this vulnerability specifically.
    No updates to tests were made in the fix. However new tests were written 
    to make sure that this vulnerability does not happen again.
    The vulnerability was discovered by a third party user and subsequent 
    bugs were discovered through code reviews.
  code: true
  fix: true

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found.
    * Answer in longform below in "answer"
    * Fill in the date in YYYY-MM-DD
    * If it's clear that the vulnerability was discovered by a contest,
      fill in the name there.
    * The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you
    may leave the entries blank except for "answer", BUT please write down
    where you looked in "answer".
  answer: | 
    This vulnerability was first reported to the Tomcat security team by Tilmann Kuhn.
    This is listed on the Tomcat website.
  date: 2012-07-19
  automated: false
  contest:

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
    Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: Digest Authenticator in Catalina
  name: authenticator

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this
    section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: | 
    There were no changes to this file between the VCC and the fix. 
    One notable detail to consider: there was a gap of a year and two months
    between the VCC and the fix. The vulnerability wasn't discovered until eleven
    months after the VCC.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
   This vulnerability was most likely made due to a design mistake. This is 
   an exploit with a high probability of occurrence and should have been considered
   in the design of the architecture. The mitigations listed suggest utilizing
   sequences or time stamping along with a checksum to ensure messages are only
   parsed once. The fix addresses this by using server nonce values instead of client
   nonce values as well as checking for stale nonce values and forcing reauthentication.
   The fix appears complete in addressing all problem areas where the exploit can occur.
