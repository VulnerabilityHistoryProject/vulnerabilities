description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description:
  Apache Tomcat (An open source implementation of the Java Servlet)
  5.5.x did not use a proper approach for handling a large number of parameters.
  There was no limit to the size of a request so attackers could utilize this to
  cause a denial of service via requests that contained many parameters which in
  turn caused a large amount of CPU to be used. The vulnerability
  was handled by making Tomcat parameter handling code efficiently process large
  numbers of parameters and parameter values.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: false
  code: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found.
    * Answer in longform below in "answer"
    * Fill in the date in YYYY-MM-DD
    * If it's clear that the vulnerability was discovered by a contest,
      fill in the name there.
    * The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you
    may leave the entries blank except for "answer", BUT please write down
    where you looked in "answer".
  answer: According to http://tomcat.apache.org/security-5.html, this bug was
    found thorugh analysis of a hash collision vulnerability
    (possibly CVE-2011-4858) which helped identify unrelated inefficiencies
    with Apache Tomcat's handling of large numbers of parameters and
    parameter values.
  date: 2011-10-21
  automated: false
  contest:

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
    Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: the mistake was in the parameters file in the connectors "subsystem"
  name: connectors

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this
    section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: I did not find any interesting fixes between the VCCs and the fix.
    Most of the files were left unchanged in the time between the VCC and the fix.
    There were a few files such as ByteChunk.java which had minor fixes to
    behavior in between the VCC and the fix.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: From what I have seen, it seems like a design mistake led to this
    vulnerability. It appears that when created, the original code did not
    account for the possibly of large/excessive parameters.This could be due to
    the fact that the developer never anticipated that their system could be
    abused in such a way. I also found it interesting that the vulnerability was
    found from investigating another vulnerability. This shows that it is
    important to consider how 1 vulnerability may be applied or affect another
    part of a system.
