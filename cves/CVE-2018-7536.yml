yaml_instructions: |
  ===YAML Primer===
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not absolutely required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  A vulnerability in Django was found that could allow an unauthenticated, 
  remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on a targeted system.
  The vulnerability can be found in the django.utils.html.urlize() function and is due to
  insufficient validation of user provided input. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker could
  submit a crafted input to an affected system and cause a denial of service attack on the targeted system.

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please explain where you looked.
  answer: James Davis reported the vulnerability to Django.
  automated: False
  contest: False
  developer: False
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: |
    A fuzzer could most likely find this vulnerability by
    submitting a crafted input to an affected system and test to see if a 
    denial of service attack on the targeted system
    would be possible.
  answer: True
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example,
    an RFC specification, a protocol specification, or a requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check all artifacts for this: bug report, security
    advisory, commit message, etc.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: There is no mention of a specification being followed for this code.
  answer: False
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Most systems don't have a formal list of their subsystems, but you can
    usually infer them from path names, bug report tags, or other key words
    used. A single source file is not what we mean by a subsystem. In Django,
    the "Component" field on the bug report is useful. But there may be other
    subsystems involved.

    Your subsystem name(s) should not have any dots or slashes in them. Only
    alphanumerics, whitespace, _, - and @.Feel free to add multiple using a YAML
    array.

    In the answer field, explain where you saw these words.
    In the name field, a subsystem name (or an array of names)

    e.g. clipboard, model, view, controller, mod_dav, ui, authentication
  answer: |
    The html.py file in which the vulnerability was found describes this 
    file to be "HTML utilities suitable for global use" and it is located within a utils folder
    leading me to the conclusion that this is best described as the html utility subsystem.
  name: html utility
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
    - commit: ed114e15106192b22ebb78ef5bf5bce72b419d13
      note: |
        This commit is interesting because it is the start of the problem with this urlize function.
        In this commit it starts out innocent as a function whose purpose is to "Convert any URLs in text into clickable links.".
        After 13 years the function has grown out of proportion it has inner functions, is hard to follow, and is slow.
    - commit: 1ca63a66ef3163149ad822701273e8a1844192c2
      note: |
        Its amazing it took over 13 years to finally create a unit test for this function.
        Had its original creator started with unit tests, this function may have stayed maintainable.
        Instead it is overcomplex and hard to follow.
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)? An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be boolean. Write a note about how you came to the conclusions
    you did.
  answer: False
  note: It had nothing to do with internationalization, it had to do with catastrophic backtracking vulnerabilities in two regular expressions.
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer should be boolean.
  answer: False
  note: I found no inter-process communication.
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

      Had the original author put some form of protection against DOS attacks such as timeouts for functions, 
      at worse all the attacker could do is cause a timeout, instead of taking down an entire system.
  yagni:
    applies: False
    note:
  complex_inputs:
    applies: True
    note: |
      The vulnerability involved the parsing of a regular expression, which is
      a very complex language.
mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    In my opinion, the reason this vulnerability surfaced was because, the code became overly complex and untested.
    The urlize function in 2005 was 29 lines with the sole responsibility to "Convert any URLs in text into clickable links".
    As of 2018 when the fix was added, it was found to be at 132 lines with 4 in-line functions. 
    Over the course of 13 years the function size and complexity has increased by 4.5 times the orginal amount. 
    If the function had been written initially with unit tests I suspect the function would not have grown so largely
    out of proportion and a more modular design would have been implemented. Unfortunately due to the high complexity of this method
    I assume only more vulnerabilities will be found over time, especially if it keeps getting added too and is not refactored.
