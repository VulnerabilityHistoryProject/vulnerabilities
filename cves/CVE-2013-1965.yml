description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Struts-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Struts would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  The vulnerability was in the XWork core library of Struts 2. OGNL code--an expression 
  language which can get and set fields and call methods in Java--could be injected 
  as a parameter name.  Although this was partially handled in earlier bug fixes 
  (S2-003, S2-005, and S2-009), these fixes did not account for a specific case in 
  which the parameter name could still be evaluated as OGNL code during a redirect, 
  a sort of double-evaluation.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: |
    Looking at the codebase, it is clear that the vulnerable code is tested, but 
    no test changes were made for the fix.
  code: true
  fix: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Apache
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulnerability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.
    The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    The "apache" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you may
    leave the entries blank except for "answer". Write down where you looked in "answer".
  answer: |
    This was discovered by Xgc Kxlzx, a third-party security developer. It is unstated 
    on the CVE page and bug reports how the vulnerability was discovered.
  date: 2013-22-05
  automated: false
  apache: false
  contest:

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged. Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: Based on bug reports, comments, and commit messages.
  name: XWork core

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this section
    by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: |
    Only one commit touched the main file in question and was interesting. Other commits 
    made minor changes to logging and exception handling.
  commits:
    - commit: cc6edbb49a31e06b7fbf3b2a9e97f898e677e9b5
      note: |
        This commit was the primary attempt to solve this issue prior to the final fix. 
        It added code to check if a tree is an OGNL eval statement, but, ultimately, it 
        did not cover the case which caused this vulnerability.
   
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note: |
      The eventual fix for this vulnerability was simply to disable OGNL evaluation 
      by default because sanitizing the parameter names was not sufficient. This 
      a two-layered security system for this vulnerability.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those in the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The problem which caused this vulnerability was one of design. The conclusion 
    eventually reached was that OGNL evaluation in XWork core simply cannot easily 
    be implemented in a secure manner. After multiple attempts to sanitize input, 
    the solution was to just disable OGNL evaluation by default.
    
    Additionally, the multiple attempts at fixes show that testing may not have 
    been thorough enough to push those fixes to production. New edge cases kept 
    popping up and requiring small adjustments until this final solution was 
    reached.
