description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: |
  The vulnerability is an example of session fixation. This is when a malicious
  actor hijacks a valid user session. Usually, when a user is authenticated the
  application should be assigned a new session Id, but when they are not, the
  attacker can reuse that session id to gain access. In this case, there was a
  field in the request object that was not renewed (requestSessionSSL), for new
  sessions, so theoretically if an attacker created a request object and forced
  the user to somehow use it, then they could gain access because they would have
  the requestSessionSSL field to authenticate. This attack would also require the
  web application to be set up to use ssl session id as the http session id which
  is an uncommon setup.

Basically, they were working on the cookie parser, and also made additions to the Coyote Adapter which is when they recycled the cookie. They forgot to also recycle the session here

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: I can tell this was unit tested by reading the bug report. Author Mark Thomas says that the tests passed against the session vulnerability. As for fix, I do not see any unit tests that were added as part of the fix.
  code: true
  fix: false

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?
    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found.
    * Answer in longform below in "answer"
    * Fill in the date in YYYY-MM-DD
    * If it's clear that the vulnerability was discovered by a contest,
      fill in the name there.
    * The "automated" flag can be true, false, or nil.
    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then you
    may leave the entries blank except for "answer", BUT please write down
    where you looked in "answer".
  answer: This vulnerability was discovered by the tomcat security team. They discovered it when they realized Tomcat incorrectly handled different session settings when multiple versions of the same web application was deployed
  date: 2014-06-22
  automated: false
  contest: false

subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
    Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"
  answer: it lists the component in the bug report
  name: Catalina Connector

interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?
    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
    If there are no interesting commits, demonstrate that you completed this
    section by explaining what happened between the VCCs and the fix.
  answer: Yes there is a revision 1667546 that implemented Tomcat authorization. It takes a user and adds roles to it. During this revision, multiple files were changed at once from the FormAuthenticator to the AuthenticatorBase. Of which, both Request.java and CoyoteAdapter were changed. In this, they recycled the authtype along with other user information. It is interesting because you would think in this large feature addition, they would add a check for ensuring the session was cleared after a new deployment began. Session and authentication go hand in hand. If the session is compromised then authentication is rendered useless.

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note: Instead of depending solely on the session id to authenticate, if the developers used defense in depth to create an additional layer of security such as two-factor authentication, then the vulnerability would be avoidable.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: From looking at the prior code and the fix, it seems evident that the developers were falling into the long method trap. When this happens, the code can become hard to follow and one method ends up doing multiple different things. In this case postParseRequest handled logic for cookies and sessions. When session was being cleared, multiple lines to clear the attributes of the session were written, instead of creating a helper method that focused solely on session clearing. This led them to forget to clear one attribute that opened the system up to session fixation. In the future, it is important that you write helper functions to eliminate long methods, and improve readibility to prevent errors like this.
