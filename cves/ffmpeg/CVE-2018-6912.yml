  ===YAML Primer===
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings

  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon

  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces.

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not absolutely required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  When parsing audio-visual data for Ut Video Codec files, a fast and lossless video codec, 
  no check is done for the length and integrity of the inputted file. Should this file 
  change in size during the decoding process or be carefully crafted such that the format 
  is against specifications, an out of array read occurs, leading to a potential 
  Denial of Service. 
  Attackers could craft files empty or variable length files leading to crashes, 
  threatening the integrity and availability of any system running FFmpeg.

lifetime:
  question: |
    We consider the "lifetime" of this vulnerability to be from the earliest
    VCC to the latest fix.

    How would you characterize the development of this vulnerable code during
    its lifetime? Many new features? Neglected? One developer?
    Massive refactoring? Changing big dependencies?
    Changing architectures or language?


    What about the time period for the project itself?
    Did it undergo big changes during this time?

    Look at:
      * the commit messages between the two, using a command like
          git log --stat abc..def -- your/file.c
          (where a)
      * the changelog between the two
  answer: |
    This file was largely untouched in the two months between the vccs and the fix itself.
    A different developer than the one who committed the fix added a one line fix for another similar array reading issue. 
    This developer would go on to be the one who found the vulnerability and made its subsequent fix.

    In this span FFpeg 4.0 "Wu" was under development. Countless filters and codecs continued to be added
    but this was largely a time focused on refinement, as 4.0 would release merely two months later in April.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For code: and fix: - your answer should be boolean.

    For the code_answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix in related directories and determine if and was there were
    unit tests involved for this subsystem. The code

    For the fix_answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.

    In FFmpeg, they have the FATE suite of regression tests. They are not
    "unit" tests per se, but are automated regression tests. If the fix for the
    vulnerability involved adding or updating a FATE suite, then make fix: true.
  code: false
  code_answer: No unit tests were found.
  fix: false
  fix_answer: |
    No changes to FATE were made with the fix. This area was not included in [code coverage](http://coverage.ffmpeg.org/index.src_libavcodec_utvideodec.c.html)
    at time of the vulnerability, nor was it covered with the fix. To this day this area remains untested.
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Find any relevant bug reports or mailing list conversations read the
    conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer".

    If it's clear that the vulenrability was discovered by a
    contest, fill in the name of the contest in "answer".

    If it's clear that it was found by a developer of the project itself,
    e.g. from the email address or a previous committer.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please
    explain where you looked. Thus, 'answer' should always have some
    explanation.
  answer: |
    No direct attribution, as no developer, fuzzer, nor contest was was credited on mailing lists, 
    code reviews, forums, nor commits. Possibly found by a FFmpeg developer and security advocate,
    Michael Niedermayer, who added various additions to this file to make it more secure. 
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: true
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow,
    use-after-free

    Examples for false: specification violations, permissions issues, anything
    that would require a tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: |
    An automated tool may have been able to find this. Testing different 
    input data sizes, randomizing input data, or modifying data mid-parsing
    would have led to a crash, revealing this vulnerability.
  answer: true
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example,
    an RFC specification, a protocol specification, codec spec, or a requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check all artifacts for this: bug report, security
    advisory, commit message, etc.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: | 
    The vulnerability causing commit introduced support for UMH2, UMY2, 
    UMH4, UMY4, UMRA, and UMRG, all of which are speed-focused Ut Video codecs.
  answer: true
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.

    In FFmpeg, the Component field is useful here. Often people will say
      "undetermined" - do more homework than them and make a judgement call if
      you can.

    Note: a filepath is NOT a subsystem - that's too granular.

    A non-exhaustive examples for ffmpeg are:
      * avcodec
      * avdevice
      * avfilter
      * avformat
      * avutil
      * build system
      * documentation
      * fate
      * ffplay
      * ffprobe
      * postproc
      * swresample
      * swscale
      * tools
      * trac
      * website

    If this involves fixing multiple subsystems, you can make this an array.

    In 'answer', explain how you arrived at this determination.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was found in the Ut Video decoder. This is one of many
    decoders that make up avcodec, the generic encoding/decoding framework.
  name: avcodec
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Optional: are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    This is a catch-all for any interesting commit you find.
    Example of interesting commits:
      * Giant refactors
      * Changing an API or big dependency
      * A change that looks really sketchy
      * Commits where a developer mentions security in their message or comments
  commits:
  - commit: 118e1b0b3370dd1c0da442901b486689efd1654b
    note: | 
      Between the vcc and the fix, another out of array read issue was fixed. This further
      demonstrates how many FFmpeg vulnerabilities are fixed after new codecs are added in large
      batches, indicating a maintainability issue.
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)? An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be boolean. Write a note about how you came to the conclusions
    you did.
  answer: false
  note: This is not an i18n issue, it's an input validation issue.
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer should be boolean.
  answer: false
  note: The input data comes in over IPC, but this is not an IPC issue.
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Design mistakes? Maintainability? Requirements?
    Miscommunications? Lack of testing? Lack of understanding? Lack of
    specifications? Working alone?

    An answer like "it was just a coding mistake" is not thoughtful enough.
    If it's such an easy mistake to make, how was it missed?

    Also, look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    Technically this vulnerability occured due to a lack of distrust of the input data. 
    While the codec may have been implemented due to spec, specs don't always account for 
    distrust or invalid input to the extent needed in a proper application that we can 
    expect to be tampered with or eventually error out.

    Further, I believe that a lack of testing, requirements, and manpower lead to 
    this vulnerability being allowed into the codebase. FFmpeg is a large project, 
    with new codecs added on the regular. Many new codecs, like the one involved here, 
    are added by a single developer. These files tend to be poorly documented, lack unit
    testing, and seemingly are added without much code review. With an inability to test 
    such files and most security review done by a single developer, it's good that this
    vulnerability was caught so early in the lifetime of this codec, as it could have
    gone unnoticed for years, like countless other FFmpeg vulnerabilities.
    
    Having stricter requirements for upfront testing alongside more active developers 
    involvedin each new codec would help to stop more of these vulnerabilities from being 
    introduced, and should they still slip in, allow for them to be caught faster.
