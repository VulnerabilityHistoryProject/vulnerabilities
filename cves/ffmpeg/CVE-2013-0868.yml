  ===YAML Primer===
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings

  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon

  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces.

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not absolutely required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  When parsing audio visual data for Huffyuv codec files, a lossless Win32 video codec,
  various error conditions like invalid input formats, empty lengths, etc. can occur. 
  If one of these are hit, an error code is returned, indicating something went wrong.
  
  In this case the error return codes from functions in the Huffyuv decoder are never checked.
  Additionally, some basic checks, such as ensuring the file isn't empty, are never made.
  Together these allow an attacker to sneak an empty or invalid file in, which will result 
  in an out of bounds write. This write can lead to disruptions, Denial of Service, and other
  unintended behaviors.

lifetime:
  question: |
    We consider the "lifetime" of this vulnerability to be from the earliest
    VCC to the latest fix.

    How would you characterize the development of this vulnerable code during
    its lifetime? Many new features? Neglected? One developer?
    Massive refactoring? Changing big dependencies?
    Changing architectures or language?


    What about the time period for the project itself?
    Did it undergo big changes during this time?

    Look at:
      * the commit messages between the two, using a command like
          git log --stat abc..def -- your/file.c
          (where a)
      * the changelog between the two
  answer: |
    This file went through some minor refactors between the vcc and the fix itself.
    At one point this file was split into two files, one for encoding and one for decoding,
    which continues to be the standard in FFmpeg to this day. 
    The file did go through some small pointer refactors and code style updates, but no one changed
    core functionality or seemingly did any security checks until the fix was added years later.
    
    The project evolved quite a bit throughout the lifetime of this file, as around six years passed.
unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For code: and fix: - your answer should be boolean.

    For the code_answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix in related directories and determine if and was there were
    unit tests involved for this subsystem. The code

    For the fix_answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.

    In FFmpeg, they have the FATE suite of regression tests. They are not
    "unit" tests per se, but are automated regression tests. If the fix for the
    vulnerability involved adding or updating a FATE suite, then make fix: true.
  code: false
  code_answer: Minimal unit tests were found, but with lacking coverage in this area.
  fix: false
  fix_answer: |
    No changes to FATE were made with the fix. This file has some code coverage as
    of the most recent commits, but I'm unable to confirm if this existed beforehand.
    Either way, this coverage doesn't test any of the vulnerability stopping statements
    or edge cases that exist for malformed files.
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Find any relevant bug reports or mailing list conversations read the
    conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer".

    If it's clear that the vulenrability was discovered by a
    contest, fill in the name of the contest in "answer".

    If it's clear that it was found by a developer of the project itself,
    e.g. from the email address or a previous committer.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please
    explain where you looked. Thus, 'answer' should always have some
    explanation.
  answer: |
    No direct attribution, as no developer, fuzzer, nor contest was was credited on mailing lists, 
    code reviews, forums, nor commits. Possibly found by a FFmpeg developer and security advocate,
    Michael Niedermayer, who added various additions to this file to make it more secure.
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: true
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow,
    use-after-free

    Examples for false: specification violations, permissions issues, anything
    that would require a tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: |
    An automated tool may have been able to find this. Testing different
    input lengths and empty inputs (len of 0) would have resulted in an out of
    bounds write, leading to noticable disruptions in the application.
  answer: true
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example,
    an RFC specification, a protocol specification, codec spec, or a requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check all artifacts for this: bug report, security
    advisory, commit message, etc.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: |
    The vulnerability itself wasn't mentioned to be against any spec, but this
    vulnerability was caused by adding addition support for Huffyuv, a lossless
    video codec.
  answer: true
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.

    In FFmpeg, the Component field is useful here. Often people will say
      "undetermined" - do more homework than them and make a judgement call if
      you can.

    Note: a filepath is NOT a subsystem - that's too granular.

    A non-exhaustive examples for ffmpeg are:
      * avcodec
      * avdevice
      * avfilter
      * avformat
      * avutil
      * build system
      * documentation
      * fate
      * ffplay
      * ffprobe
      * postproc
      * swresample
      * swscale
      * tools
      * trac
      * website

    If this involves fixing multiple subsystems, you can make this an array.

    In 'answer', explain how you arrived at this determination.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was found in the Huffyuv decoder. This is one of many
    decoders that make up avcodec, the generic encoding/decoding framework.
  name: avcodec
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Optional: are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    This is a catch-all for any interesting commit you find.
    Example of interesting commits:
      * Giant refactors
      * Changing an API or big dependency
      * A change that looks really sketchy
      * Commits where a developer mentions security in their message or comments
  commits:
  - commit: 2ca5ca2957607cf9604cc6068a9ebc898ff37b06
    note: Large refactor which split codecs into distinct sections. Interesting as it shows that no one retested functionality or seemed to check security, rather they assumed it was safe.
  - commit:
    note:
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)? An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be boolean. Write a note about how you came to the conclusions
    you did.
  answer: false
  note: This is not an i18n issue, it's an input validation issue.
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer should be boolean.
  answer: false
  note: The input data comes in over IPC, but this is not an IPC issue.
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Design mistakes? Maintainability? Requirements?
    Miscommunications? Lack of testing? Lack of understanding? Lack of
    specifications? Working alone?

    An answer like "it was just a coding mistake" is not thoughtful enough.
    If it's such an easy mistake to make, how was it missed?

    Also, look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability occured due to a mix of a lack of testing and a lack of review.
    Some measures already existed in this video decoder to indicate a parsing failure,
    however they were not checked. Other checks were missing completely, such as checking
    if the file length was greater than 0. These are issues that should have been caught
    with a manual review or testing, as they are quite basic error handling/input validation
    issues.
    Further, added codecs lack proper ongoing testing. Countless refactors/splits occured
    in this file and other codecs in the many years between the vcc and fix, but no one seemed
    to question the functionality or retest it. FFmpeg codecs seem to have few maintainers who
    understand each, relying too much on certain knowledgeable individuals to find and fix such
    issues eventually. The proper mitigations for an out of bounds write were made, but this
    vulnerability existed for more than half a decade, indicating issues with code testing.
