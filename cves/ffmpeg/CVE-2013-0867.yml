  ===YAML Primer===
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings

  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon

  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces.

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not absolutely required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  The vulnerability was in libavcodec/h264.c that does not properly check the
  input whenever there is a change in the pixel format. The existing check for
  the pixel input before FFmpeg 1.1.2 is not sufficient to detect a pixel format
  change. This resulted in improper input validation that the data is not 
  processed correctly. It will crash due to out-of-bounds array access.

  The way this could be exploited is that an attacker can have an 
  impact through H.264 video data which will not be specified for developers 
  to figure out what impact it will cause.

lifetime:
  question: |
    We consider the "lifetime" of this vulnerability to be from the earliest
    VCC to the latest fix.

    How would you characterize the development of this vulnerable code during
    its lifetime? Many new features? Neglected? One developer?
    Massive refactoring? Changing big dependencies?
    Changing architectures or language?


    What about the time period for the project itself?
    Did it undergo big changes during this time?

    Look at:
      * the commit messages between the two, using a command like
          git log --stat abc..def -- your/file.c
          (where a)
      * the changelog between the two
  answer: |
    The lifetime of this vulnerability is about 9 years. There was a massive
    refactoring for this code such as integer overlow and buffer overflow. 
    Handling the inputs became more specific that the code had to be edited a
    lot as the developers put a lot of input handling cases.
unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For code: and fix: - your answer should be boolean.

    For the code_answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix in related directories and determine if and was there were
    unit tests involved for this subsystem. The code

    For the fix_answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.

    In FFmpeg, they have the FATE suite of regression tests. They are not
    "unit" tests per se, but are automated regression tests. If the fix for the
    vulnerability involved adding or updating a FATE suite, then make fix: true.
  code: false
  code_answer: |
    It does not show that the unit was tested in the origianl code.
  fix: false
  fix_answer: |
    It does not show that the unit was tested in the fixed code.
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Find any relevant bug reports or mailing list conversations read the
    conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer".

    If it's clear that the vulenrability was discovered by a
    contest, fill in the name of the contest in "answer".

    If it's clear that it was found by a developer of the project itself,
    e.g. from the email address or a previous committer.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please
    explain where you looked. Thus, 'answer' should always have some
    explanation.
  answer: |
    It is not clear how the vulnerability was discovered by looking at the 
    commit message and the code change in the commit. 

    There might have been a test against the code which can be putting a lot of
    different inputs and check the result. Another possibility might be that 
    there was a crash due to out of array accesses.
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: false
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow,
    use-after-free

    Examples for false: specification violations, permissions issues, anything
    that would require a tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: |
    SQL injection, XSS, and buffer overflow can be used to discover if there
    is a vulnerability in this code since this vulnerability is CWE-20:
    Improper Input Validation. The tools that can discover those invalid inputs
    can be a fuzzer, where you can try putting inputs to see if it returns
    improper outputs. Also it can be discovered by compiler warnings when an
    invalid input was used which resulted in a crash due to out-of-bounds array
    access. Manual and Automated Static Analysis are also the way to discover
    this vulnerability since they are all dealing with the input validation.
  answer: true
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example,
    an RFC specification, a protocol specification, codec spec, or a requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check all artifacts for this: bug report, security
    advisory, commit message, etc.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: |
    There is no violation of a specification found in the commit messages.
  answer: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.

    In FFmpeg, the Component field is useful here. Often people will say
      "undetermined" - do more homework than them and make a judgement call if
      you can.

    Note: a filepath is NOT a subsystem - that's too granular.

    A non-exhaustive examples for ffmpeg are:
      * avcodec
      * avdevice
      * avfilter
      * avformat
      * avutil
      * build system
      * documentation
      * fate
      * ffplay
      * ffprobe
      * postproc
      * swresample
      * swscale
      * tools
      * trac
      * website

    If this involves fixing multiple subsystems, you can make this an array.

    In 'answer', explain how you arrived at this determination.
  answer: |
    In commit hashes under vcc in this yml file, avcodec and avformat were the
    only directories that the fixes were made.
  name: [avcodec, avformat]
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Optional: are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    This is a catch-all for any interesting commit you find.
    Example of interesting commits:
      * Giant refactors
      * Changing an API or big dependency
      * A change that looks really sketchy
      * Commits where a developer mentions security in their message or comments
  commits:
  - commit: 11c99c78bafa77f679a1a3ba06ad00984b9a4cae
    note: |
      This is a giant refactor that directly handles the vulnerability which
      checks the pixel format and forces re-initialization on mismatches. This
      is to validate inputs for the pixel format changes when there are some
      damaged streams.
  - commit:
    note:
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)? An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be boolean. Write a note about how you came to the conclusions
    you did.
  answer: true
  note: |
    The internationalization is involved in this vulnerability since it is the
    improper input validation for H.264 that is the most widely used codec.
    Since H.264 is used for broadcast and streaming video markets for all over
    the world, it is true that the internationalization is involved.
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer should be boolean.
  answer: true
  note: |
    IPC is involved in this vulnerability since if there is improper input for
    H.264, there would not be a proper output which will be resulted in a crash
    playing a video and such.
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note: |
      Defense in Depth can serve as a good protection for this vulnerability as
      it will protect the asset from unauthorized or improper modification to
      the input. Defense in Depth will only accept good inputs as a thorough
      input validation strategy. This vulnerability comes from not checking or
      validating inputs correclty so taking valid inputs will block modifying
      the assets improperly.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Design mistakes? Maintainability? Requirements?
    Miscommunications? Lack of testing? Lack of understanding? Lack of
    specifications? Working alone?

    An answer like "it was just a coding mistake" is not thoughtful enough.
    If it's such an easy mistake to make, how was it missed?

    Also, look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The mistake that led to this vulnerability is that the code is lack of
    validation for the pixel format. If there were enough testing processes
    that caught this problem, the vulnerability would not exist. Since it does
    not properly validate input, it can cause unspecified data flow which can
    be resulted in out-of-bounds array access. 
    When writing a code, all the requirements for each function need to be 
    handled specifically. Testing is also significant to handle this type of 
    vulnerability such as unit testing. 

    Potential mitigations to this vulnerability are Attack Surface Reduction
    and Input Validation. Those can mitigate this vulnerability. Attack Surface
    Reduction strategy lets developers understand all areas that potentially
    have untrusted inputs such as arguments, parameters, environment variables,
    filenames, etc. Input Validation helps developers assume that all inputs
    are malicious so that they can reject inputs that are not specified and 
    correclty handled.
