  ===YAML Primer===
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings

  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon

  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces.

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not absolutely required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  A memory corruption vulnerabilty for audio conversion allowing 
  an attacker to inject remote attacks using vectors related to channel layout 
  (i.e. av_get_channel_layout_nb_channels). By exploiting this vulnerabilty, 
  the attacker can alter the intended control flow, read sensitive information,
  and even cause the system to crash.

  The avcodec_decode_audio4 method performs read and write operations to the 
  memory location that is outside the bounds of the memory buffer.

lifetime:
  question: |
    We consider the "lifetime" of this vulnerability to be from the earliest
    VCC to the latest fix.

    How would you characterize the development of this vulnerable code during
    its lifetime? Many new features? Neglected? One developer?
    Massive refactoring? Changing big dependencies?
    Changing architectures or language?


    What about the time period for the project itself?
    Did it undergo big changes during this time?

    Look at:
      * the commit messages between the two, using a command like
          git log --stat abc..def -- your/file.c
          (where a)
      * the changelog between the two
  answer: |
    From the top of my head, I remember at least 10 developers that worked on 
    utils.c between the first VCC and fix. I noticed that many of the commits 
    had merge conflicts for many of the files in libavcodec. I would say the
    code around the vulnerabilty was continuously changed, without the actual
    vulnerabilty being fixed.
unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For code: and fix: - your answer should be boolean.

    For the code_answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix in related directories and determine if and was there were
    unit tests involved for this subsystem. The code

    For the fix_answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.

    In FFmpeg, they have the FATE suite of regression tests. They are not
    "unit" tests per se, but are automated regression tests. If the fix for the
    vulnerability involved adding or updating a FATE suite, then make fix: true.
  code: true
  code_answer: "There were unit tests involved in utils.c"
  fix: false
  fix_answer: "This doesn't involve adding to the unit tests"
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Find any relevant bug reports or mailing list conversations read the
    conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer".

    If it's clear that the vulenrability was discovered by a
    contest, fill in the name of the contest in "answer".

    If it's clear that it was found by a developer of the project itself,
    e.g. from the email address or a previous committer.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please
    explain where you looked. Thus, 'answer' should always have some
    explanation.
  answer: Michael Niedermayer discovered the memory corruption
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: true
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow,
    use-after-free

    Examples for false: specification violations, permissions issues, anything
    that would require a tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: |
    After doing some preliminary research, it is possible to automate the 
    discovery of memory corruption by setting the crash as a trigger to 
    initiate an automatic diagnosis algorithm
  answer: true
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example,
    an RFC specification, a protocol specification, codec spec, or a requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check all artifacts for this: bug report, security
    advisory, commit message, etc.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: |
    There were no specification violations mentioned in the bug reports 
    or commit messages.
  answer: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.

    In FFmpeg, the Component field is useful here. Often people will say
      "undetermined" - do more homework than them and make a judgement call if
      you can.

    Note: a filepath is NOT a subsystem - that's too granular.

    A non-exhaustive examples for ffmpeg are:
      * avcodec
      * avdevice
      * avfilter
      * avformat
      * avutil
      * build system
      * documentation
      * fate
      * ffplay
      * ffprobe
      * postproc
      * swresample
      * swscale
      * tools
      * trac
      * website

    If this involves fixing multiple subsystems, you can make this an array.

    In 'answer', explain how you arrived at this determination.
  answer: |
    the subsystem, libavcodec was determined by cross-checking commit messages 
    with the CVE vulnerabilty on the website where the path of the file gave 
    indications of the subsystem name.
  name: "libavcodec"
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Optional: are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?

    This is a catch-all for any interesting commit you find.
    Example of interesting commits:
      * Giant refactors
      * Changing an API or big dependency
      * A change that looks really sketchy
      * Commits where a developer mentions security in their message or comments

  - commit: 57231e4d5b467833fb289439cd35a92513bb55c1
    note: |
      This commit dated 2012-12-08 looks particularly dodgy because of the insane
      number of merge conflicts it has. The commit message says that the commited 
      changes were not merged at the request of the maintainer, which raises red-
      flags for some potential communication issues.
  - commit: 64bb3fa6b7f5b2db22b7577585d5861be24eebd8
    note: |
      Over here, Michael is adding "braces" to "shut-up" the gcc warnings. This is
      another cause for concern as the team is not taking necessary precautions 
      against warnings (may or may not be directly linked to the vulnerabilty but 
      still caught my attention)
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)? An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be boolean. Write a note about how you came to the conclusions
    you did.
  answer: true
  note: |
    i18n can be applied to this subsytem, as users around the world use the audio 
    conversion algorithms to their benefit.
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer should be boolean.
  answer: false
  note: |
    This feature didn't use any sort of IPC (i.e. pipes/stdin/stdout).
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Design mistakes? Maintainability? Requirements?
    Miscommunications? Lack of testing? Lack of understanding? Lack of
    specifications? Working alone?

    An answer like "it was just a coding mistake" is not thoughtful enough.
    If it's such an easy mistake to make, how was it missed?

    Also, look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    From the commit messages, it was clear that the developers working on
    utils.c were largely ignoring gcc and other warnings that were being presented 
    to them. Additionaly, there were far too many merge conflicts present in the 
    commit history between the first VCC and fix, which indicated that there were 
    communication issues amongst the developers. Furthermore, some type of dynamic 
    analysis should have been perfomed using automated results interpretation 
    (i.e. web application scanner). Such tools are useful in reporting out-of-bounds 
    memory operations.
