description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.
  Rewrite this description in your own words. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.
  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove Chromium-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to Chromium would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.
description: 

    Apache Tomcat includes a web application called the Manager. This tool is 
    used to deploy new web applications, to undeploy currently deployed web 
    applications, to reload existing web applications, and to perform other 
    operations to change and monitor the availability of the user's web 
    applications.
    
    Another web application included in Apache Tomcat is the Host Manager. The 
    Host Manager is used to manage the different virtual hosts (server-sharing 
    wesites) on the user's Tomcat server.
    
    CVE-2015-5351 refers to a vulnerability in the Manager and Host Manager web 
    applications. An unauthenticated user attempting to accessing the index page 
    of either of these web applications would be issued a redirect from the 
    server with a valid CSRF token. An attacker may use this token to send 
    requests to the web application which would have been considered invalid 
    without the token's inclusion.
    
    It is worth noting that because these applications are intended for managing
    the user's apache server, they are not usually exposed to the internet.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?
    Write the reasoning behind your answer in the "answer" field.
    For the "code" answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix and determine if and was there were unit tests involved
    for this module. Must be just "true" or "false".
    For the "fix" answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
    Must be just "true" or "false".
  answer: no unit test found
    
  code: false
  fix: false

  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?
    Look at the path of the source code files code that were fixed to get
    directory names. Look at comments in the code. Look at the bug reports how
    the bug report was tagged.
    Examples: "clipboard", "gpu", "ssl", "speech", "renderer"

lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?
    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.
    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.
    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?
    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?
    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: 
    No changes were made to the file housing the vulnerability in the time 
    between its introduction and its correction. When the vulnerability was 
    finally fixed, it was done by the same person who had introduced it 5 years 
    prior. It seems like one of the issues that may have lead to this bug was 
    lack of eyes on the code. When a component does not have many maintainers, 
    and when those maintainers do not interact with it often, any bugs it 
    contains are likely to last a long time.
    
    This bug is also a good illustration of the damage caused by a technology
    not being "secure by default" - in this case, JSPs which create a session
    with the client by default, regardless of whether one is needed.
