CVE: CVE-2015-5143
yaml_instructions: |
  ===YAML Primer===
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not absolutely required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: "The issue was in how Django was handling its sessions. It allowed\nunauthenticated
  attackers to create numerous sessions records potentially \ncausing a denial of
  service by filling up the session store or evicting \nother user's records.\n\nDjango
  would create a new empty record in the session storage every time \n'request.session'
  was accessed with a non-existing session key in the \nrequest cookies. To exploit
  the vulnerability, attackers can easily send \nin repeated requests with unknown
  session keys.\n"

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For code: and fix: - your answer should be boolean.

    For the code_answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix in related directories and determine if and was there were unit tests involved for this subsystem. The code

    For the fix_answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  code: true
  code_answer: "There are unit tests for the sessions backend and related code, but
    not \nthat covered or would discover this specific case.\n"
  fix: true
  fix_answer: 'They added a few new unit tests that covered the issue.

discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulnerability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please explain where you looked.
  answer: |
    2015-07-03
    The vulnerability was not discovered by a Google employee.
    Did not find any evidence on how the vulnerability was found.
    Looked for evidence in the django project issue board, cve site,
    and other vulnerability tracking sites like redhat.
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: true
discoverable:
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example,
    an RFC specification, a protocol specification, or a requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check all artifacts for this: bug report, security
    advisory, commit message, etc.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: There was not mention of a violation of any specification.
  answer: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Most systems don't have a formal list of their subsystems, but you can
    usually infer them from path names, bug report tags, or other key words
    used. A single source file is not what we mean by a subsystem. In Django,
    the "Component" field on the bug report is useful. But there may be other
    subsystems involved.

    Your subsystem name(s) should not have any dots or slashes in them. Only
    alphanumerics, whitespace, _, - and @.Feel free to add multiple using a YAML
    array.

    In the answer field, explain where you saw these words.
    In the name field, a subsystem name (or an array of names)

    e.g. clipboard, model, view, controller, mod_dav, ui, authentication
  answer: The issue in Djangos sessions code, which is located in contrib/sessions/backend.
  name: sessions
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: bcf7e9a9fe037eff4d5dea0cdd8c35104590e1a8
    note: |
      This commit added the ability to store session data in the cache or the filesystem instead
      of the database cache.
  - commit: ee28560997e324203333b891e488b2d2d7c9511d
    note: |
      Fix to avoid an infinite loop with session key generation. I found interesting because the
      original code had a while-true, and the fix involves a count loop with a hard-coded value.
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)? An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be boolean. Write a note about how you came to the conclusions
    you did.
  answer: false
  note: The vulnerability was with managing data, does not involve any i18n feature.
sandbox:
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer should be boolean.
  answer: false
  note: The vulnerability only affects data storage and not inter-process communication.
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: "I believe this was a design mistake, the developers didn't not account
    for\nor notice vulnerability their fix introduced. It was mentioned in the bug
    \nticket that the logic for creating new empty records was unnecessary.\nThe vulnerability
    might have been difficult for a automated test for find, \nbut I think would have
    been discovered in code review.\n"
