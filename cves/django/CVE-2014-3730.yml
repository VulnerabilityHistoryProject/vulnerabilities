  ===YAML Primer===
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not absolutely required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  A critical vulnerability that can be initiated remotely and with no
  form of authentication required for a successful exploitation, was found in Django. 
  Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl found that the django.util.http.is_safe_url function does not properly validate URLs, 
  which allows remote attackers to conduct open redirect attacks via a malformed URL, 
  as demonstrated by "http:\\\djangoproject.com."

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For code: and fix: - your answer should be boolean.

    For the code_answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix in related directories and determine if and was there were unit tests involved for this subsystem. The code

    For the fix_answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  code: False
  code_answer: There were unit tests but not for the method the vulnerability existed in, see a2f2a399566dd68ce7e312fff5a5ba857066797d.
  fix: True
  fix_answer: New test cases were added for the corresponding fix, see 7feb54bbae3f637ab3c4dd4831d4385964f574df.
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please explain where you looked.
  answer: Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl reported the issue to Django.
  automated: False
  contest: False
  developer: False
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: One way of finding the vulnerability was to pass in a url such as http:\\\djangoproject.com, passing in malformed URLs could be easily done by an automated tool.
  answer: True
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example,
    an RFC specification, a protocol specification, or a requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check all artifacts for this: bug report, security
    advisory, commit message, etc.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: There was no mention of a specification being followed.
  answer: False
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Most systems don't have a formal list of their subsystems, but you can
    usually infer them from path names, bug report tags, or other key words
    used. A single source file is not what we mean by a subsystem. In Django,
    the "Component" field on the bug report is useful. But there may be other
    subsystems involved.

    Your subsystem name(s) should not have any dots or slashes in them. Only
    alphanumerics, whitespace, _, - and @.Feel free to add multiple using a YAML
    array.

    In the answer field, explain where you saw these words.
    In the name field, a subsystem name (or an array of names)

    e.g. clipboard, model, view, controller, mod_dav, ui, authentication
  answer: The vulnerability was located in a http utility function whose responsibilities lie in performing http related actions, therefore it is the http subsystem.
  name: http
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
    - commit: a2f2a399566dd68ce7e312fff5a5ba857066797d
      note: |
        This commit is interesting because this is where the vulnerability is introduced. 
        It appears that the author just wanted to implement a simple validation function for the URL and did not think of every consideration, and
        in doing so introduced a vulnerability. Additionally it can be seen that no unit tests were implemented with this initial commit. If the author
        had implemented unit tests for this method, would the vulnerability have existed?
    - commit: 1a274ccd6bc1afbdac80344c9b6e5810c1162b5f
      note: |
        This commit is interesting because it was about fixing a different vulnerability having to do with rejecting incorrect schemes,
        and unit tests still were not implemented for the function. The developers of this function were able to find a different vulnerability but
        did not take the time to think about how else the function might be vulnerable, and did not unit test either.
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)? An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be boolean. Write a note about how you came to the conclusions
    you did.
  answer: False
  note: It had nothing to do with internationalization, it has to do with a lack of sanitization in URLs.
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer should be boolean.
  answer: False
  note: The affected subsystem could send http messages, however that is not inter-process.
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    This vulnerability was brought on by carelessness, the author of the is_safe_url function wrote it out of neccesity without putting 
    any real thought into the consequences of the function. The first mistake the original author made was not writing unit tests for the function.
    If unit tests were implemented I feel as though the author may have thought of additional cases to test and in doing so found the vulnerability the
    function was open to. Additionally if unit tests had been in place for the function, then different developers down the line would have been forced
    to write their own tests for the function and in doing so may have also discovered the vulnerability. One interesting note is that it appears a second
    vulnerability was found in this function as well, and that fix still did not result in unit tests, which was a mistep to be sure. If there had been a 
    requirement for unit testing alongside a more thoughtful design from the original author, this vulnerability would have never became an issue. 
    The lesson to be learned here is that even a simple function like a validation check can open you to many different forms of attack, and should be 
    considered when you are designing any piece of software large or small.
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to http://cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE
  entry that describes your vulnerability. We recommend going to
  https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/699.html for the Software Development
  view of the vulnerabilities. We also recommend the tool
  http://www.cwevis.org/viz to help see how the classifications work.

  If you have anything to note about why you classified it this way, write
  something in CWE_note. This field is optional.

  Just the number here is fine. No need for name or CWE prefix. If more than one
  apply here, then choose the best one and mention the others in CWE_note.
CWE: 20
CWE_note: |
  The vulnerability can be classified as CWE-20 because 
  the function is_safe_url does not validate or incorrectly validates input that can affect the control flow or data flow of the program.
nickname_instructions: |
  A catchy name for this vulnerability that would draw attention it. If the
  report mentions a nickname, use that. Must be under 30 characters.
  Optional.

nickname: URL Is Not Safe
