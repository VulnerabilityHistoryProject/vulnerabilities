  ===YAML Primer===
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not absolutely required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  Django is a high level web framework for python. It aims to make it easy
  to create database driven websites. This vulnerability would not correctly
  transfer a client from HTTP to HTTPS even when these proxying settings were
  configured in Django. For example if the request went to the proxy
  with HTTPS, the proxy might send it to Django with HTTP, but a secure header
  along with the request. Django would typically interpret this secure header
  in order to treat the incoming HTTP request as HTTP. With the vulnerability,
  this secure header would not be read correctly, resulting in the request
  being HTTP when it should be HTTPS. This vulnerability could result in
  unencrypted packets being sniffed due to a man in the middle
  attack or similar.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For code: and fix: - your answer should be boolean.

    For the code_answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix in related directories and determine if and was there were unit tests involved for this subsystem. The code

    For the fix_answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  code: true
  code_answer: |
    It seems the tests in place only tested if the underlying request was HTTPS,
    if there was no forwarding SSL configured, or if both the proxy and the
    request were both HTTPS. It does not seem to cover the vulnerable case of
    the client original request being HTTPS, then coming to Django as HTTP but
    with a header.
  fix: true
  fix_answer: |
    An additional test case was added to test trusting the SSL header over
    the true request header
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please explain where you looked.
  answer: |
    It seems the initial vulnerability was reported by someone named Gavin Wahl.
    See: https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2019/jul/01/security-releases/
    He is also credited the initial suggestion for the patch.
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: true
discoverable:
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example,
    an RFC specification, a protocol specification, or a requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check all artifacts for this: bug report, security
    advisory, commit message, etc.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: 'No specification is listed.

    '
  answer: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Most systems don't have a formal list of their subsystems, but you can
    usually infer them from path names, bug report tags, or other key words
    used. A single source file is not what we mean by a subsystem. In Django,
    the "Component" field on the bug report is useful. But there may be other
    subsystems involved.

    Your subsystem name(s) should not have any dots or slashes in them. Only
    alphanumerics, whitespace, _, - and @.Feel free to add multiple using a YAML
    array.

    In the answer field, explain where you saw these words.
    In the name field, a subsystem name (or an array of names)

    e.g. clipboard, model, view, controller, mod_dav, ui, authentication
  answer: |
    The class containing the vulnerability is in the package
    django.http.HttpRequest.scheme.
  name: http
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: c7634cd7fe7dc09338fcec0ca48d816a29d791b0
    note: |
      It seems this commit did some refactoring of the vulnerable code. However,
      I don't think this actually contributed any to the vulnerability.
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)? An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be boolean. Write a note about how you came to the conclusions
    you did.
  answer: false
  note: |
    This relates to HTTP requests and request headers. This would not be
    affected by i18n.
sandbox:
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer should be boolean.
  answer: true
  note: |
    This vulnerability had to do with handling network requests
    forwarded from a proxy.
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.
  defense_in_depth:
    applies: true
    note: |
      With a feature as critical as encryption, some more verification
      should have been done for ensuring the connection type is correct,
      especially when using a more complex setup like a reverse proxy for
      requests (like when the vulnerability occurs)

mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    It seems the vulnerability was caused by a misunderstanding of how a proxy
    would forward a request. The fix seems fine, opting to now always trust
    the SSL proxy header instead of just falling back to the original request
    type. This ensures that, if the flag is there from the proxy, it will always
    opt to use the secure flag.
CWE_instructions: |
  Please go to http://cwe.mitre.org and find the most specific, appropriate CWE
  entry that describes your vulnerability. We recommend going to
  https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/699.html for the Software Development
  view of the vulnerabilities. We also recommend the tool
  http://www.cwevis.org/viz to help see how the classifications work.

  If you have anything to note about why you classified it this way, write
  something in CWE_note. This field is optional.

  Just the number here is fine. No need for name or CWE prefix. If more than one
  apply here, then choose the best one and mention the others in CWE_note.
CWE: 20
CWE_note: |
  This is the CWE number listed on the NVD page for this bug. It is fitting, as
  the input, being the request from the proxy, is not properly validated
  as being HTTPS. This results in the connection falling back to HTTP, which
  is not secure.
nickname_instructions: |
  A catchy name for this vulnerability that would draw attention it. If the
  report mentions a nickname, use that. Must be under 30 characters.
  Optional.
nickname:
