CVE: CVE-2019-3498
yaml_instructions: |
  ===YAML Primer===
  This is a dictionary data structure, akin to JSON.
  Everything before a colon is a key, and the values here are usually strings
  For one-line strings, you can just use quotes after the colon
  For multi-line strings, as we do for our instructions, you put a | and then
  indent by two spaces

  For readability, we hard-wrap multi-line strings at 80 characters. This is
  not absolutely required, but appreciated.

description_instructions: |
  You can get an initial description from the CVE entry on cve.mitre.org. These
  descriptions are a fine start, but they can be kind of jargony.

  Rewrite this description IN YOUR OWN WORDS. Make it interesting and easy to
  read to anyone with some programming experience. We can always pull up the NVD
  description later to get more technical.

  Try to still be specific in your description, but remove project-specific
  stuff. Remove references to versions, specific filenames, and other jargon
  that outsiders to this project would not understand. Technology like "regular
  expressions" is fine, and security phrases like "invalid write" are fine to
  keep too.

  Your target audience is people just like you before you took any course in
  security
description: |
  By specifically crafting a url, an attacker could cause spoofed information 
  appear on the Django default 404 webpage. The method that rendered the
  template would reflect the given url in the 404 page. An attacker could make
  a url that contains html tags that would render as part of the page. This 
  leaves open the opportunity for XSS or CSRF.

fixes_vcc_instructions: |
  Please put the commit hash in "commit" below (see my example in
  CVE-2011-3092.yml). Fixes and VCCs follow the same format.
fixes:
- commit: 64d2396e83aedba3fcc84ca40f23fbd22f0b9b5b
  note: | 
    These three commits all appear to be making the same changes. The fix
    appears to be surrounding the url in quotes using the python library
    urllib before inserting it into the 404 template.
- commit: 9f4ed7c94c62e21644ef5115e393ac426b886f2e

vccs:
- commit: ed114e15106192b22ebb78ef5bf5bce72b419d13
  note: |
    This VCC was discovered automatically via archeogit. This commit appears
    to be the first spot the Django project started putting the url of a bad
    request into the 404 page, circa 2005. Any changes to the method since
    have kept the same logic to trust that the url has nothing malicious in
    it.

unit_tested:
  question: |
    Were automated unit tests involved in this vulnerability?
    Was the original code unit tested, or not unit tested? Did the fix involve
    improving the automated tests?

    For code: and fix: - your answer should be boolean.

    For the code_answer below, look not only at the fix but the surrounding
    code near the fix in related directories and determine if and was there were unit tests involved for this subsystem. The code

    For the fix_answer below, check if the fix for the vulnerability involves
    adding or improving an automated test to ensure this doesn't happen again.
  code: true
  code_answer: |
    The code is only being tested that a 404 error can be raised, since seeing
    the issue would require viewing the template
  fix: false
  fix_answer: |
    The code is only being tested that a 404 error can be raised, since seeing
    the issue would require viewing the template
discovered:
  question: |
    How was this vulnerability discovered?

    Go to the bug report and read the conversation to find out how this was
    originally found. Answer in longform below in "answer", fill in the date in
    YYYY-MM-DD, and then determine if the vulnerability was found by a Google
    employee (you can tell from their email address). If it's clear that the
    vulenrability was discovered by a contest, fill in the name there.

    The automated, contest, and developer flags can be true, false, or nil.

    If there is no evidence as to how this vulnerability was found, then please explain where you looked.
  answer: |
    The Django security release does not mention anyone that reported the
    vulnerability. But the redhat bug report mentions a Sam Fowler who
    reported it 3 days after the vulnerability was patched.
  automated: false
  contest: false
  developer: false
autodiscoverable:
  instructions: |
    Is it plausible that a fully automated tool could have discovered
    this? These are tools that require little knowledge of the domain,
     e.g. automatic static analysis, compiler warnings, fuzzers.

    Examples for true answers: SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflow

    Examples for false: RFC violations, permissions issues, anything
    that requires the tool to be "aware" of the project's
    domain-specific requirements.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: |
    This vulnerability would require an aware user to enter a non existant
    url path and view the returned 404 error page, as well as needing a user
    that knows how to craft such a malformed url, since there are no examples
    of a malformed url.
  answer: false
specification:
  instructions: |
    Is there mention of a violation of a specification? For example,
    an RFC specification, a protocol specification, or a requirements
    specification.

    Be sure to check all artifacts for this: bug report, security
    advisory, commit message, etc.

    The answer field should be boolean. In answer_note, please explain
    why you come to that conclusion.
  answer_note: |
    There is no mention of any specification violations in the security
    bulleting or the bug reports.
  answer: false
subsystem:
  question: |
    What subsystems was the mistake in?

    Most systems don't have a formal list of their subsystems, but you can
    usually infer them from path names, bug report tags, or other key words
    used. A single source file is not what we mean by a subsystem. In Django,
    the "Component" field on the bug report is useful. But there may be other
    subsystems involved.

    Your subsystem name(s) should not have any dots or slashes in them. Only
    alphanumerics, whitespace, _, - and @.Feel free to add multiple using a YAML
    array.

    In the answer field, explain where you saw these words.
    In the name field, a subsystem name (or an array of names)

    e.g. clipboard, model, view, controller, mod_dav, ui, authentication
  answer: |
    The file and functionality to render a 404 template was maintained in the
    views module of the django project.
  name: views
interesting_commits:
  question: |
    Are there any interesting commits between your VCC(s) and fix(es)?

    Write a brief (under 100 words) description of why you think this commit was
    interesting in light of the lessons learned from this vulnerability. Any
    emerging themes?
  commits:
  - commit: 90ac02300e754bdc1a2658ef21737c28fc522148
    note: |
      Not an issue that I would have thought of, but his commit gives the 404
      page renderer the decorator that requires it to have a csrf token.
i18n:
  question: |
    Was the feature impacted by this vulnerability about internationalization
    (i18n)? An internationalization feature is one that enables people from all
    over the world to use the system. This includes translations, locales,
    typography, unicode, or various other features.

    Answer should be boolean. Write a note about how you came to the conclusions
    you did.
  answer: false
  note: |
    This vulnerability is not effected by i18n, since urls are not translated.
ipc:
  question: |
    Did the feature that this vulnerability affected use inter-process
    communication? IPC includes OS signals, pipes, stdin/stdout, message
    passing, and clipboard. Writing to files that another program in this
    software system reads is another form of IPC.

    Answer should be boolean.
  answer: false
  note: |
    This vulnerability does not effect inter-process communication, 
    just what the user sees.
lessons:
  question: |
    Are there any common lessons we have learned from class that apply to this
    vulnerability? In other words, could this vulnerability serve as an example
    of one of those lessons?

    Leave "applies" blank or put false if you did not see that lesson (you do
    not need to put a reason). Put "true" if you feel the lesson applies and put
    a quick explanation of how it applies.

    Don't feel the need to claim that ALL of these apply, but it's pretty likely
    that one or two of them apply.

    If you think of another lesson we covered in class that applies here, feel
    free to give it a small name and add one in the same format as these.

  distrust_input:
    applies: true
    note: |
      The issue that created the vulnerability was trusting that a url would
      not have malicious content in it, and it was never validated.

    note:
  yagni:
    applies: false
    note:
  complex_inputs:
    applies: true
    note: |
      The issue required input that was more complex than the average url
      and somehow contained malicious code to be displayed to the end user
      in a 404 page.
mistakes:
  question: |
    In your opinion, after all of this research, what mistakes were made that
    led to this vulnerability? Coding mistakes? Design mistakes?
    Maintainability? Requirements? Miscommunications?

    Look at the CWE entry for this vulnerability and examine the mitigations
    they have written there. Are they doing those? Does the fix look proper?

    Use those questions to inspire your answer. Don't feel obligated to answer
    every one. Write a thoughtful entry here that those ing the software
    engineering industry would find interesting.
  answer: |
    The mistake the developers made was trusting that there would be no
    malicious content in a url.
