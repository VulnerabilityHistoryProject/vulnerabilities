# A file name that ends with this string is considered to be source code
# The way I found these was to do this at the root of the git repo
#
# find -type f | cut -c 3- | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq > ~/tomcat_exts.txt
#
# I just did the tomcat/ master repo, not the tomcat55 and tomcat80 repos too
#
# Then filtered by hand. Remove anything compressed, binary, dev-tools, etc.
