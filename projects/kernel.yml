vulnerabilities_description: |
  These vulnerabilities have been reported and confirmed by the Linux development team. Special thanks to the folks at the [Linux Kernel CVE](https://www.linuxkernelcves.com/) for tracking this data.
developers_description: |
  The following is a list of developers who are involved in code that was found to be vulnerable. Specifically, developers end up here if they were the author of a commit to code that was, at some point in time, fixed for a vulnerability. Note that this is NOT a comprehensive list, as Linux has thousands of contributors

# A file that ends with this string is considered to be source code
# The way I found these was to do this at the root of the git repo
#
# find -type f | cut -c 3- | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq > ~/chromium_exts.txt
#
# Tons of OWNERs files and DEPS files. Remove those.
# sed -i '/OWNERS/d' ~/chromium_exts.txt
# sed -i '/DEPS/d' ~/chromium_exts.txt
# sed -i '/README/d' ~/chromium_exts.txt
#
# It's also pretty unlikely that a file extension has more than 10 characters.
# sed -i '/^.\{10\}./d' ~/chromium_exts.txt
#
# That brings the list down to ~500, so manually edit from there.
#
# Then filtered by hand. Remove anything compressed, binary, dev-tools, etc.
